Shimu Pan:

The links for images and background and sound effects are described in Joshua's Readme but ill include it here too

For the Constitution, we used "https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/".

For the background, we found a free wooden background found at "https://www.myfreetextures.com/seamless-wood-texture/"

For the eagle sound effect we downloaded in from "https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/eagle-screech-29416/"

I worked on the code a little bit by making a version of the current one that loaded the text via drop down instead of on click. 

We decided to scrap that idea because it might take a long time to code up.

Then I took the task to provide my own analysis for article 5-7 and amendments 1-24 (summary)

I also fixed a bug that made the text in the middle of the page move whenever buttons are hovered. 

This was fixed by simply making the button bigger so when it becomes bold on hover, it wouldn't move the page
