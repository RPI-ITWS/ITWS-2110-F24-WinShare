Joshua Collins:

For the Constitution, we used "https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/".
For the background, we found a free wooden background found at "https://www.myfreetextures.com/seamless-wood-texture/"
For the eagle sound effect we downloaded in from "https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/eagle-screech-29416/"

I created the inital HTML, CSS, and JS.
I did the Constitution Title with the screeching sound. 
I also did the "The Constitution's History " and "The Preamble" tabs

I wrote the inital js code that my team then revisied and optimized.
