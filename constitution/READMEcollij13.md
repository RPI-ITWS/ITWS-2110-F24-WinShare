Joshua Collins:

For the Constitution, we used "https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/".
For the background, we found a free wooden background found at "https://www.myfreetextures.com/seamless-wood-texture/"
For the eagle sound effect we downloaded in from "https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/eagle-screech-29416/"

I created the inital HTML, CSS, and JS.
I did the Constitution Title. 
I also did the "The Constitution's History " and "The Preamble" tabs. This includes the original text and analysis.
I added the analysis provided by my team to the respective tabs. Occassionaly rewording phrases used to keep the idea more inline with the topic of the section.

I wrote the inital js code that my team then revisied and optimized.

The only issues i ran into was getting the buttons and Titles to be perfectly centered. Often, the Title would be slightly off to the right due to the sizing of the right button.
Luckily after some minor altering of the button sizes, everything aligned perfectly. It also took me a bit to get the javascript running to display the desired text because I got
two variables mixed up, but soon realized and fixed my error. 

I also aimed for clear comunication about what i was adding to the website and when I was adding it. I was striving to do my part early on so my team wouldn't have to wait on me.
