Louis Hung:

At the start of this lab we talked about the general work shared to each individual, where I am assigned to make most of the analysis for each articles

I initially wrote the analysis and summary for each article's section, but then we realized that the summaries and analysis are basically corresponding to each other, therefore we replaced the analysis with the summary of each article section.

As an result of my progress in the lab, I wrote article analysis for most of the Articles being displayed, including some of my own analysis on how each article's section meant and why was it invented.

I also contributes to the team discussion in the early stage about how each section should look like and how do we want the text of summary and analysis to be displayed.

We initially decided that the eagle sound would be perfect in letting people remembering our lab, but that idea got rejected by Dr. Callahan as is would be disturbing for people.
