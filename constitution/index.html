                    <p>In 1787, the framers had come to realize that the Articles of Confederation were too weak. This document gave too much power to the staes while undermining the power necessary for a federal govenrment to hold. As a result, The federal govenrment had little authority to hold states accountible and keep the nation as a whole stable. Seeing the short coming of the Articles of Confederation, the framers sought to develope a document that gave more power to the federal govenrment. For example, the framers wanted the new federal govenrment to have three distinct and seperate branches of government: an executive, legislative, and judicial branch. Knowing that the federal govenrment needed more power, but also wary that too much centralized power leads to corruption, the framers added checks and balances to keep these three new branches no more powerful than the other two. This marked the beggining to drafting the Consititution.</p>
                    <p>The Constitiution was ratified on June 21st, 1788 when New Hampshire, the 9th state, ratified it.</p>
                    <p>While the Constitution was faring alot better than the Articles of Confederation, Anti-Federalists, were concerned that the new document didn't protect individual liberties. This could be an issue if the government decided to enact new laws that theoretically oppressed it citizens. To prevent this, The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitiution. This marked the first time the country added to it foundational document. The Bill of Rights consists of 10 amendements that prevents the government from taking away unalienable right. Some of these rights include: Free Speech, Freedom of religion, Freedom of the Press, The right to bear arms, No unusual or cruel punishments, etc. These rights are deemed unalienable because no government should be able to disarms its constituants from their voices and their ability to defend themselves.</p>
                    <p>More amendements were added later on, such as: The 11th Amendment (1795) limits the ability of individuals to sue states in federal court. The 12th Amendment (1804) revises the presidential election process, requiring separate votes for President and Vice President. The 13th Amendment (1865) abolishes slavery, while the 14th Amendment (1868) guarantees citizenship rights and equal protection under the law. The 15th Amendment (1870) prohibits voting restrictions based on race. The 16th Amendment (1913) allows Congress to levy an income tax. The 17th Amendment (1913) establishes the direct election of U.S. Senators. The 18th Amendment (1919) institutes Prohibition, which is later repealed by the 21st Amendment (1933). The 19th Amendment (1920) grants women the right to vote. The 20th Amendment (1933) shortens the period between federal elections and the start of congressional and presidential terms. The 22nd Amendment (1951) limits the President to two terms. The 23rd Amendment (1961) grants Washington, D.C. electoral votes in presidential elections. The 24th Amendment (1964) abolishes poll taxes. The 25th Amendment (1967) establishes procedures for presidential succession and incapacity. The 26th Amendment (1971) lowers the voting age to 18. Finally, the 27th Amendment (1992) delays laws affecting congressional salaries from taking effect until after the next election.</p>

                <div id="Article1Analysis" class="text">
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 1</p>
                    <p>This section grants Congress the ability to enact all legislative duties that comes with running a country. This allows congress to enact laws that are in accordance with the constitution and amendments.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 2</p>
                    <p>This section highlights the criteria to be a member of the House of Representatives and their powers while in office. For example, the ability to impeach, which would be used against the President, Vice-President, or Federal-Officials when they have committed Treason, Bribery, or any other "high crime / misdemeanor." The section also outlines that the population of the states are what determines the number of seats a state has and their taxes. The House gives seats to states in a more proportional manner, elections held every two years, with the idea the house more accurately reflects the people's short-term ideals. Each Representative within the house can be no younger than 25 years old and have been a citizen for seven or more years.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 3</p>
                    <p>This section highlights the details regarding how the senate functions. The senate hosts elections every six years, where each state and D.C. has two senators. Each senator has to be at least 30 years old and been a citizen for nine years or more. The Vice-President holds the duty to resolve ties in the senate when there is a tie regarding any vote. The senate as a duty to hold impeachment trails once an impeachment was been voted and approved by the House of Representatives. The senate serves the purpose of representing all states equally, so states with big populations cannot oppress smaller states. The senate servers as a safety net, denying bills that could harm the nation because they are brough up in intense short-terms emotional turmoil. The senate has to determine if a bill should go to the president or do they not align with the best interest of the entire nation ideals.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 4</p>
                    <p>Election of Congress Members would be decided by the state, which generally implies that the state would choose which party to stand on and choose the corresponding members of the parties. Congress’ power to amend is probably only for special times where they really have to amend it. Congress must always be in session on December 1st of each year.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 5</p>
                    <p>Both houses of Congress must establish rules, determine the requirements for membership, maintain a record of its actions, and need a quorum in order to function. Both Houses should act independently to establish how they operate so there isn't anyone controlling them but the houses as whole hold themselves accountable. The duties carried out by both houses are transparent, so anyone can see what happens, but also prevents outside forces from interfering with this operation.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 6</p>
                    <p>This section outlines how Congress is paid. They can only be paid by the Federal Government while holding office. Members of Congress cannot be arrested unless they've committed serious crimes. Members cannot hold any other positions in the federal government. This prevents the president from also being a senator at the same time, and also prevents from Congress being paid directly from other companies while in office. Any other income would be viewed as illegal income of a congressman.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 7</p>
                    <p>Only the house can create laws aimed at generating revenue. A bill needs to first be approved by both chambers of Congress. Then, if passed, a bill could be signed by the president in order to become law. If the president vetoes a bill, the veto can be overridden by two-thirds of both houses. A vetoed bill can still become law. This section outlines how federal laws are proposed and come into existence.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 8</p>
                    <p>Congress can declare war, assemble armies, control commerce, levy taxes, and enact any laws required to carry out its powers. While the president commands the military, congress holds the power to decide when we can go to war. This section is used to define Congress' powers as a collective. Congress' should be self-sufficient in carrying out the powers that the Constitution bestows on the institution.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 9</p>
                    <p>The importation of slaves cannot be prohibited by Congress until 1808. It cannot issue bills of attainder or ex post facto laws, grant titles of nobility, or suspend habeas corpus except in cases of extreme necessity. This section prevents the importation of slaves into the United States. This was added in a time where half the nation wanted to abolish slavery and the other half did not want to abolish slavery. This is a compromise where the nation cannot import slaves, but the slaves that were already here were still free game until the enactment of the 13th amendment.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 10</p>
                    <p>States are states and they are not nations. they cannot overreach on their duties and power. They are not allowed to make treaties, print money, or bestow noble titles. These powers are given to Congress, for this reason, the federal government holds power over the states, but the states elect the officials in the federal government. This is to prevent anyone state from overstepping their role, but all states should be fairly represented by the federal government.</p>

                    <p>The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows</p>     
                    <p>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.</p>                
                    <p>The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.</p> 
                    <p>The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.</p> 
                    <p>No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.</p>     
                    <p>In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.</p>                
                    <p>The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.</p> 
                    <p>Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:- I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.</p> 
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 2</p>
                    <p>The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.</p>     
                    <p>He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.</p>                
                    <p>The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.</p> 
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 3</p>
                    <p>He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.</p>

                    <p>The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 1</p>
                    <p>The President, elected alongside the Vice President for a four-year term, holds executive power. States choose electors based on congressional representation, and if no candidate wins a majority, the House of Representatives selects the President, while the Senate picks the Vice President. The President must be a natural-born U.S. citizen, at least 35 years old, and a 14-year resident. In case the President can't serve, the Vice President takes over. The President swears an oath to defend the Constitution, and their salary can't change during their term. Winning the presidency often depends on securing key states, not just overall popular support. This serves as a basis for how the executive branch is elected and installed every four years.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 2</p>
                    <p>The President may consult with the heads of executive departments in his capacity as Commander in Chief of the armed forces. In addition to signing treaties and appointing ambassadors, judges, and other federal officials with Senate consent, the President may forgive, with the exception of situations involving impeachment. Moreover, the President may appoint replacements when the Senate is in recess. This section highlights the powers and duties of the president. For example, the president is the commander and chief of the military. When congress declares war, the president has complete control over military operations within the confines of maintaining the military and directing the military during the duration of their term and in wartime.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 3</p>
                    <p>The President is required to report to Congress on the status of the Union, suggest appropriate actions, call a special session of Congress or adjourn it, welcome foreign dignitaries, ensure that the law is properly carried out, and commission all officers of the United States. This allows the citizens of the United States to have transparency with what the state of the federal govenrment and our country. Although the president avoids taking about their shortcommings and glorifies the benefits of their term, we the people, can still have a simple understanding how the nation is doing under this current president.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 4</p>
                    <p>Treason, bribery, or other major offenses are justification for the impeachment and removal of the President, Vice President, and other federal authorities from office. This highlights what a president can be tried for when it comes to impeachment. These are the only reasons a president can be impeached. This process is to curb the executive branch from committing wrong doing to maintain power or abuse power.</p>

                    <p>The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 2</p>
                    <p>The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State,—between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.</p>          
                    <p>In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.</p>
                    <p>The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.</p>          
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 3</p>
                    <p>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.</p>
                    <p>The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 1</p>
                    <p>The United States focuses its judicial power in the hands of one supreme body and many lesser bodies, the highest body being the Supreme Court. The United States permits Congress to establish inferior courts as needed. These supreme judges serve for life, provided that uphold the law, making them the guardians of the law. As a reward for this service, they will get a fixed salary that will not drop while they are in office, guaranteeing their own financial security. This establishes the frame work of the judicial system within the US and how it functions.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 2</p>
                    <p>The judicial power in the United States covers all several kinds of legal cases. These cases included the Constitution, U.S. Laws, Treaties, cases related to ocean and ships, disagreements between U.S. Government, disagreement between states, and conflict between people of different states or countries.</p>
                    <p>When a case involves ambassadors or government officials or a state is involved in a dispute, the Supreme Court will personally handle the case. Congress can set some rules on how Supreme Court handles these cases.</p>
                    <p>When someone is charged with a crime, they will have the right to a trial by jury. This section highlights what cases the Supreme court and lesser federal courts have rule over.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 3</p>
                    <p>This section provides a strict definition of treason, one of the most serious crimes. Treason against the United States means either starting a war against the country or helping United States enemies. Strong evidence is needed to convict someone of treason, such as two witnesses to the same overt act or an honest confession given in court. Congress has the authority to choose the punishment for treason, but it cannot impose a sentence that will last the rest of the guilty person's life and extend their family. This sets a clear definition to treason so a vague definition cannot be misconstrude later on.</p>

                    <p>The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.</p>

                    <p>Every state shall acknowledge and honor the public acts, documents, and court rulings of other states. The rules that govern the legal implications of these acts, records, and procedures are established by Congress.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 2</p>
                    <p>Every state's people are entitled to the same benefits and rights as those of other states. When someone is accused of a crime in one state and leaves the country, the authorities in the original state have the right to request that the accused individual be brought back to face justice. Furthermore, if someone escapes from a state where they owe work or service (according to state rules of slavery, for example), they must be brought back to that state. This is to highlight that all states are apart of a union that defines America as it is. Simply fleeing to another state means you're still in the same country and must be returned to the state were crime or service was committed.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 3</p>
                    <p> Congress could agree to new states' requests to join the Union, but it cannot create new states by dividing or combining existing ones without the consent of Congress and the legislatures of the affected states. In order to prevent any state or territorial rights from being prejudiced, Congress also has authority over federal property and U.S. territory. This is to prevent states from splitting apart simply because they do not let being apart of an existing state. This process of creating a new state from existing state's territory has to be slow and difficult to pass. This way the nations aren't thrown into disarray every time a state has two disagreeing parties.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Section 4</p>
                    <p>The United States assures each state of a republican system of governance and pledges to defend them against invasion and, upon request from the state legislature or governor, from domestic assault. All staes are apart of the United States, so an attack on any one of them is an attack againstt the entire country. This was to secure unity during wartime especially during the founding years of the United States.</p>

                    <p>Congress cannot make any law that will take away freedom of speech or freedom of the press or freedom of assembly or freedom of religion. These freedoms are unalienable rights granted to us by god rather than any government. Colonists pre 1776 couldn't openly bad mouth the British Crown.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">2nd Amendment</p>
                    <p>Another right granted by god is the right to seld defense. Citizens of the United States have the right to own firearms and use them against all threats, foreign and domestic, if it is an instance of self defense. The Crown forebid colonists from owning guns so the colonists could never stage a revolution. Throughout history, oppressive govenrments will try to disarm citzens to prevent revolts. This amendemnet is meant as a backup if a tyrannical government tries to oppress their citizens.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">3rd Amendment</p>
                    <p>American homes belong to the people that inhabit them. The owners of these houses do not have to allow soldiers to spend the night there is the owner doesn't want them there. This was becuase the Crown made colonists house soliders at any time. The soldiers would eat food and not repaid the home owner for the food they had to give up.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">4th Amendment</p>
                    <p>Guarantees people right to privacy and security in their bodies, homes, belongings, and documnets. Government cannot search or take these without good reason. A warrant must be issued before a search or seizure is conducted. The government must follow transparent procedures when going into private buildings.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">5th Amendment</p>
                    <p>Protects citizens from being forced to testify agaisnt themselves in crimial cases and that citizens are guaranteed the right to a grand jury trial. This is applied by simply remaining silent, as saying something may acutally incriminate yourself later on.</p>

                    <p>Courts cannot set super high bail or fines and cruel and unusual punishment cannot be used on people. This prevents brutal punishments such as the idea of "an eye for an eye" which is still practiced today in parts of the world. Now you are sent to serve time in prision, pay a fine, serve community service, etc.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">9th Amendment</p>
