We initially discussed where our skills and weaknesses lie and determined who was doing what. 

At first, I started to write some of the original analysis however I had an idea to include animations and change the CSS to the buttons.  

I had to refresh my memory on transitions in CSS so I used “https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp” to help me

I also had to add some Js to help make the animation slide in and out making it smoother. The animation will add or remove “show” to the class with a specific time which will make it look less clunky. 

I used “https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp” site to figure out how to do the setTime Also, “https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp” to relearn classList remove functions. 

I also had other additions including centering the spacing between the buttons and title of each section as well as adding padding between sections.
