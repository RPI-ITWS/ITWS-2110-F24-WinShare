Pranay Sharma:

I altered the style sheet and customized the interface more.

The original background was a wooden one from "https://www.myfreetextures.com/seamless-wood-texture/". But was decided to be maybe changed.

The 2nd considered background is that of crumpled paper from "https://pikbest.com/backgrounds/crumpled-paper-vintage-wallpaper-aged-texture-in-brown_9938291.html".

I then darkened it and converted it to a jpeg.

I changed the font of each header and title to "gothicus-roman" which wad downloaded from adobe fonts.
