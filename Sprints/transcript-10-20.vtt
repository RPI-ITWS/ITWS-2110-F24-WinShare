WEBVTT

1 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:22.329
So I have done the login to sign up and log out. Let me share my screen to show you how it works. Okay, nice. Using sessions is actually easier than what I remembered it to be.

2 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.531
Oh, so you ended up using session sort of cookies.

3 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:32.067
Yeah, yeah, because literally I was reading some documentation it was like literally just type in session start.

4 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.303
It'll start working, and that's basically what happened.

5 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:40.714
What are you looking at?

6 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:41.686
The.

7 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:44.971
Is this?

8 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:50.365
Yeah, some, some webpages might be still broken because.

9 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:52.931
Oh wait, yeah.

10 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:00:52.931 --> 00:01:20.227
Yeah, so I've converted all the files to PHP, meaning that like some of the I might miss some like things where I'm not including the nav bar correctly should work. Yeah, we can fix that later. Yeah, so now I have dynamically updated the leader the the map bar. So when you log in, it'll show your name and it won't show login, logout or sign up, whatever. It'll only show logout.

11 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:23.333
Let's log out here.

12 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:38.045
It's trying to make a new account with sign in, so it would be profile now with login sign up. Let's do like test user emails arbitrary, we don't really, we're not gonna make them like very.

13 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:42.729
We're not gonna yeah. But that verification sounds really good though.

14 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:51.326
Yeah, it sounds cool, but we're probably gonna have to use like a separate API for it, but we could have, we'll implemented if.

15 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:01:51.326 --> 00:02:01.249
I mean we can just use it right? We can just do anything right now and like if we have time we have time but yeah so.

16 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:10.368
That makes a new entry in the database. So this guy oh it also also encodes the password.

17 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:02:10.368 --> 00:02:12.090
Oh, you have like a.

18 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:30.630
Yeah, it has a built in functional yeah so NO just PHP. They literally have a built in let me see, it's like, it was all good, it was like it literally has password, it was like, password_hash.

19 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:48.729
That's like a whole function to hash it. And you just you just unhash it when you when you log in. So let's log in with the test person ok so now you logged in, go to work.

20 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:02:49.630 --> 00:03:06.746
Just Refresh the page if you're still logged in, just like hop around to statistics. Oh, I didn't I don't have it pulled yet. So I can only go to like, like, I don't know, another page here.

21 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:12.032
Okay is generally not working.

22 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:03:12.032 --> 00:03:17.265
It is working. I just didn't pull the new changes that we did on Friday.

23 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:18.125
Ah.

24 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:22.866
Ah ok because I I my branch is like couple commits behind.

25 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:25.568
No, it's ok. Your hard will.

26 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:37.165
It's actually a lot of behind, but that's what I've been working on. I'll try to fix the cu like the mergers by today. Maybe we could just do it in the meeting.

27 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:47.609
Yeah, but yeah I'm actually down to just keep a napart like this, to be honest.

28 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.147
Yeah, I think it's cool.

29 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:56.566
Yeah, like if you think it's too annoying to fix, I think keep keeping it this way is honestly idea.

30 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:03:56.566 --> 00:04:06.066
No, I'm just saying not for not for our work, I just did something extra that made a break. So like.

31 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:17.566
I mean like I mean like you hide the function where you hide home statistic prediction, yeah. Like I kind of like just having like this on the top.

32 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:19.190
Yeah, it might be because.

33 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.532
Oh, you're not smaller screen, so automatically.

34 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:28.765
I mean honestly if you prefer it to be like this I think.

35 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:32.005
But I guess it's a bootstrap function.

36 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:37.290
Yeah, yeah, it's some bootstrap stuff. Okay, yeah.

37 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:52.234
I mean everything works now, so array, let's do get pull order main and let's see what happens. Oh yeah, can you also like Can you share the xamp database?

38 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:04:53.766 --> 00:05:00.271
You can like download a copy of the database? Because I want I kind of wanted to start with the profile page.

39 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:03.404
Yeah for sure. I just gotta remember how to do it.

40 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:07.108
Export I think.

41 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:21.805
Export equal I don't think this matters ok.

42 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:31.576
Yep and just like put in the, put in this quote or GitHub and it should work. Yep.

43 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:05:31.576 --> 00:05:34.406
Alright, let me see how much mergers they have.

44 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:05:35.953 --> 00:05:46.669
Holy **** bro. 7000 row? Oh my god. Yeah anyways let me just send this underscored.

45 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:54.613
Yeah, because I want to get started on the PHP part or not not like user data part.

46 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:57.127
Like like a profile page, right?

47 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:05:57.127 --> 00:06:13.712
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause I currently have, I currently have dummy data for it and it's basically just player name, score, correct, wrongs, and then a profile pick.

48 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:06:13.712 --> 00:06:23.306
Oh, I see. Okay, so right now my guy only has, we only have username password points row in.

49 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:26.286
Email. Yeah, I mean we can we can just we can always add some.

50 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:29.068
Yeah, I could always ask them, which one are you thinking about him.

51 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:06:29.068 --> 00:06:41.792
I'm, what I currently have on for the leaderboard page to run is scores number one. So that's points. And I have rounds correct, rounds wrong.

52 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:43.852
Oh, like that.

53 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:06:43.852 --> 00:06:47.654
So far, right? Yeah. Like that's like a basic stats.

54 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:49.474
I see, so like wind.

55 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:06:49.474 --> 00:07:02.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then that's for like the what's it called again? That's for like the wind ratio or like the correct percentage and then I have a profile pick that I want to do like a profile pick selection.

56 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:10.154
I see, I see. Okay, I'll add them right now and just send the new update.

57 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:07:10.154 --> 00:07:15.774
I guess it's fine if it didn't add it because I'll have to do it anyways.

58 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:07:15.774 --> 00:07:18.115
I mean that's true, yeah. You can just do install.

59 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:23.532
And update it when yeah yeah yeah ok.

60 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:07:23.532 --> 00:07:30.573
What else do we have to work on? Or what is like our next big milestone?

61 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:07:30.573 --> 00:07:36.135
I guess API data's API data. Yep.

62 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:39.231
Oh, for like, the thing.

63 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:53.233
For MBA MBA data. Cause currently, I think all of our HTML pages are basically done.

64 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:54.914
Does this work?

65 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:07:54.914 --> 00:08:05.414
Isn't there like a stats page, stats pool? Like I saw someone changed this page.

66 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:08:05.414 --> 00:08:07.653
I don't know I'm trying to feel amazing.

67 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:14.700
But he committed.

68 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.613
Here you go, I didn't I didn't approve it. It's probably this, right?

69 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:08:20.613 --> 00:08:24.399
Probably, yeah.

70 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:26.474
I'll check that out later.

71 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:34.522
I merged one of them and there's a, Yeah, there's one by Isaac.

72 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:45.652
Yeah, so I I didn't have any work on from yesterday to today, but.

73 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:08:45.652 --> 00:08:47.900
I will I will.

74 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:08:47.900 --> 00:09:14.612
Work on like the profile page and I'll make sure that it looks something similar to the wireframe. The wireframe is also yeah yeah and I kind of want to start pushing like what's what's he called again? Yeah. He didn't do anything now.

75 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:21.993
That is true. Does, did he ever say what he wanted to do like back end front end API?

76 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:09:21.993 --> 00:09:23.383
Anything? Nope.

77 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:09:23.383 --> 00:09:28.595
I don't I don't think he was here for for most of the meetings to be honest.

78 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:43.606
I don't think he was here, like, Yeah, I don't think he was here, so, I don't know. He sounds, he sounds like he's gonna do CSS and the class presentation.

79 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:46.007
I mean that's trivial.

80 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:09:46.007 --> 00:10:04.949
That's just, yeah, that's just bullshit that's yeah that's stuff honestly yeah but I don't know. I I don't think you'll want to figure out APIs. Yeah.

81 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:11.824
Okay, I got the merge.

82 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:14.209
You're.

83 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:31.853
The one thing though, so actually it should be why my five commits behind me.

84 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:10:31.853 --> 00:10:35.176
Oh yeah, it's very possible your five commits behind me.

85 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:42.531
I thought I fixed that I'm still behind. Okay.

86 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:57.572
Four commits ahead of five commits behind main. Oh my god.

87 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:10:57.572 --> 00:11:06.505
Yeah, it's a ******* mess right now. Maybe we, maybe we should have started with PHP, maybe.

88 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:08.381
Start web PhP.

89 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:11:08.381 --> 00:11:12.639
Start started with just straight up BHP.

90 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:16.126
Yeah, of course we should do it from BHP.

91 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:11:16.126 --> 00:11:21.700
Because we were starting like we eventually had to migrate to PHP.

92 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:31.253
Yeah, anyways? Oh, ok. I think I fixed it. Five commits ahead of me.

93 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:45.689
That's good. That means I'm caught up with main, so if you look at like leaderboard, it's all PHP files, you have index.PHP, and you have exam, right?

94 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:11:45.689 --> 00:11:48.250
I do, yeah. Alright nice.

95 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:54.547
And this is what I meant by header breaking. I made header into like a react component.

96 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:58.027
So the.

97 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:11:58.027 --> 00:12:06.127
Yeah, so it's like it's basically you could think of as a react component, you could you just paste it like this. Otherwise, every file had like this ******* big.

98 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:12:06.127 --> 00:12:08.587
Apply the code. Yeah.

99 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:12:08.587 --> 00:12:16.047
But Yeah, so that also helped me lo like make logout and stuff easier as well.

100 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:18.709
Yeah, we definitely need that.

101 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:27.449
I just didn't remember how to do it from intro. I cause I remember we had to do it, but I 1st forgot how to do it.

102 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:12:27.449 --> 00:12:33.648
I had to like go I had to do so much documentation work on PHP because I literally forgot every.

103 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:41.268
Being about BHP. Yeah, literally four years ago. Exactly rob.

104 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:12:41.268 --> 00:12:45.108
Where is not part located by the way?

105 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:12:45.108 --> 00:12:48.473
I don't know. You tell me who changed it?

106 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:12:48.473 --> 00:13:00.965
I forgot. Oh, it's ok. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is the so far, so like just imagine this like 50 lines of code pasted everywhere.

107 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:05.447
Oh, such easier. Yeah that makes it much eas.

108 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:09.486
Like how sessions like how easy session is, but I literally just type session.

109 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:13:09.486 --> 00:13:12.047
But that's that's just like five lines, the ****?

110 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:13:12.047 --> 00:13:28.088
Yeah, I just do session start and this is for logout, so you don't have to worry about this. And at once I have session set, right? They have basically the session things inside these variables. Like these are basically php's global variables where you can use.

111 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:29.905
You can just quote user ID here.

112 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:13:29.905 --> 00:13:37.927
Yeah, like user ID, username to get like the the user information basically after you log in.

113 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:13:37.927 --> 00:13:40.789
Oh, and it's like phpfls O.

114 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:48.048
Oh, that's yeah yeah and this is global variables so you can use it everywhere. And yeah, fls.

115 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:51.988
****! Okay, so sessions is really easy.

116 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:13:51.988 --> 00:14:07.667
Yeah, it is really easy, I was gonna do cookies, but I'm like how am I supposed to do cookies for PHP? So I was like NO add some pictures though. It'll make everyone's life easier.

117 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:14:07.667 --> 00:14:20.469
Pictures you mean for a main page or oh, just like oh oh just yeah Honestly, we're not really reading the.

118 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:38.969
Yeah, I will If I have time I will like go through your branching ship, but I'm too lazy these days wanna Sometimes too lazy I don't even wanna, like, go into page.

119 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:14:38.969 --> 00:15:00.048
Oh, I also gotta make it so I'm pretty sure right now when you're logged in, you could still visit the logged in page, which is not normal, think it's something like this.

120 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:15:00.048 --> 00:15:02.605
Oh, nope.

121 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:12.324
Off/login/login.BHP. Yeah, you can ok you can still visit login when you're.

122 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:16.312
I mean, if you don't provide a link to it, NO one would go there.

123 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:15:16.312 --> 00:15:18.090
I mean, I lost it.

124 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.489
Except for.

125 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:27.605
I'll like like open a bug report or something, we can fix that later. Yeah.

126 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:15:27.605 --> 00:15:32.586
So can we like change something on the projects part?

127 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:33.389
Okay.

128 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:44.315
What do you mean? Oh yeah, we can.

129 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:15:44.315 --> 00:15:53.047
Okay. Luckily the merge mergers weren't that hard luckily.

130 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:15:53.047 --> 00:15:56.208
Luckily, yeah. Yeah, I just had.

131 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:15:56.208 --> 00:16:06.268
To delete a bunch of files. Alright cool. What are we gonna work on next? So you're working on profile.

132 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:24.426
Yeah, I'm I'm adding it in in the project page. I'm gonna add some to do ok let me, how did I add the add item, ok. One is the profile page?

133 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:16:24.426 --> 00:16:27.348
We should do something about this main page here.

134 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:16:30.684 --> 00:16:44.505
Yeah game data's inside over here. Yeah, we should put like the games happening today at this area. So we need like the like my prediction page.

135 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:47.685
Right, just like shrink it and put it inside.

136 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:48.880
Our prediction.

137 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:16:48.880 --> 00:17:00.003
Try visit like the prediction page that we did before or do you have it on your thing? You don't have it on your yeah you don't have it on your branch.

138 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:17:00.003 --> 00:17:15.865
We should have a way to start it's a new push, so.

139 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:19.747
Yeah, thus.

140 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:33.760
Predictions.HTML. Oh, ok, let me just link it to the quick then how did GitHub not catch this? Oh, right, it's because I made it header.PHP.

141 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.423
It's a whole new. I see, I see.

142 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:51.164
Do we have the statistics page?

143 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:17:51.164 --> 00:18:10.302
I think we do, but it's like a very, a very brief one because we currently did not pull any API data. That's fine.

144 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:18:10.302 --> 00:18:16.186
Productions, productions. Do these naming is like so weird.

145 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:18:17.624 --> 00:18:26.261
So the HTML and statistics is called index.HTML and the one in predictions is called prediction.HTML.

146 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:37.008
I mean I named the prediction and Joshua named the statistics. Oh yeah, like this. Yeah. So I think we should basically put this into.

147 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:18:37.008 --> 00:18:40.921
Oh, like, the main page.

148 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:51.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh ****, what the ****? Is it not working? Oh, got it. Oh, maybe oh it's absolute I think.

149 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:18:51.090 --> 00:19:15.347
Yeah, we we gotta give that time for like a r Z index or something Okay so we put like like a small version of predictions here.

150 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:19:15.347 --> 00:19:17.368
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

151 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:19:17.368 --> 00:19:23.640
Yeah, and I also want to put like games happening today, returned from my API, like all the way down.

152 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.949
Here. That's just the prediction, NO?

153 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:19:25.949 --> 00:19:36.462
No it could be like upcoming games right here or will that be included in predictions?

154 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:19:36.462 --> 00:20:04.782
Right cause like the prediction page right now is not really the prediction, it's just like the games that you can bet on, but they're like, and I want to do like so if you click into that thing, it will show the games that you can bet on and like the details. So, oh, I see. So you have like a separate page for the game? Yeah, that's what I want to do, but I didn't I didn't do that yet.

155 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:20:04.782 --> 00:20:11.981
Okay, I mean, I still gotta know how the API works well.

156 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:20:11.981 --> 00:20:17.490
The API is relatively easy, I think. At least the sports radar looks easy.

157 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.264
Yeah, sports radar is good, but I just don't know how to use the other one.

158 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:20:21.264 --> 00:20:24.344
Okay don't.

159 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:20:24.344 --> 00:20:27.004
I don't know I don't I don't like.

160 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:20:27.004 --> 00:20:32.107
Yeah, I mean it's good, but I don't want to use it. They don't have any documentation as well.

161 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:38.794
Yeah, and do have like PHP API call documentations.

162 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:20:38.794 --> 00:20:41.873
Yeah, yeah, I saw it like it gives you the.

163 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:50.349
Yeah, I just give you the code and you just copy and paste. I think that's really nice. Yeah.

164 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:59.009
I guess that's it. Oh, when you make profile page, link these players to the profile.

165 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.967
Link these.

166 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:21:00.967 --> 00:21:07.697
Oh wait, do we, then do we need like a profile for others to see their profile for yourself?

167 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:21:07.697 --> 00:21:17.885
I guess we could just have, like, it'll be the same thing, I guess. Like the profile you see is the profile other people see as well. Yeah.

168 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:20.644
That makes sense. Okay.

169 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:21:20.644 --> 00:21:23.649
Cause everything's helped with?

170 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:37.826
Yeah search bar to search for players, go to your profile, but that needs to be when profile page is done, what you're gonna be working on.

171 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:21:37.826 --> 00:21:40.647
Okay, I'll add an issue then.

172 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:46.686
I guess for here, we can stop using mock data now because we can actually have users.

173 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:21:46.686 --> 00:21:54.671
Yeah, we should just just create some like fake users.

174 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:59.804
Yeah, we can just create some fake users and different scores.

175 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:21:59.804 --> 00:22:11.951
Yeah, I mean like the JavaScript for this is just the JavaScript script for this is done, so we just have to like replace the data's.

176 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:16.006
Yeah, we could just like get the top ten, like most.

177 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:19.105
Yeah, there shouldn't be that for those.

178 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:29.385
Yeah most Yeah most like point people and just display it and set the data. So that's fine. And here as well.

179 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:22:29.385 --> 00:22:33.069
No, that, that used the same thing I just created.

180 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:22:33.069 --> 00:22:34.948
A smaller.

181 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:22:34.948 --> 00:22:39.647
And a smaller CSCS for it. It's also dynamically changed.

182 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:22:39.647 --> 00:22:42.407
I see using the same JavaScript.

183 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:22:42.407 --> 00:22:45.833
Basically the same, I just delete some from the main page.

184 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:22:45.833 --> 00:22:50.786
All right, that's cool. Just gonna add a way to like if you click on the dude, you go to your profile.

185 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:58.139
Yeah, I'm I'm adding an issue to that. That's why.

186 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:22:58.139 --> 00:23:20.272
Why some.

187 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:23:20.272 --> 00:23:23.469
I think that's it.

188 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:28.014
Basically it, yeah.

189 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:23:28.014 --> 00:23:36.006
Just that the API front end stuff, maybe could that this middle section.

190 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:23:36.006 --> 00:23:42.210
Yeah, but we have to 1st get the API running.

191 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:53.028
And for statistics for the part where were you providing our statistics, do you, do you find your old data yet from your old projects that you're talking about?

192 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:23:53.028 --> 00:23:59.429
It's not really compatible though like when I looked at the API data and my old data.

193 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:24:00.387 --> 00:24:09.093
Oh really? Yeah, I have it. Okay, let me take out my hard drive.

194 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:24:09.093 --> 00:24:15.204
I mean honestly, how uncompatible is it? Because technically, we just need the numbers, you know.

195 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:21.309
Okay, so do you have like something like two teams and there's a number?

196 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:24:21.309 --> 00:24:51.899
I have two, I have two teams and then I think I have for each team, Wait, let me find it. Where's this? Data set ok yeah this is.

197 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:24:51.899 --> 00:25:09.689
A very large data set. I'll start sharing so it looks like this.

198 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:25:09.689 --> 00:25:27.349
Oh my god, I don't care. Yeah, so, this is it? This might be. Yeah, this is it. Is this? I forgot. It so it looks like something like this.

199 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:25:27.349 --> 00:25:31.318
Okay, so this is like the data for each player.

200 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:25:31.318 --> 00:25:45.179
Two points percentage, three points percentage, blah blah blah blah blah. I forgot where that goes. And let me find.

201 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:25:45.179 --> 00:26:04.762
I guess This is the one that I used, I think. This is the main one.

202 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:26:04.762 --> 00:26:07.317
Okay, so we have.

203 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:26:07.317 --> 00:26:18.243
And Visitors, and then home teams, then the visitor scores and home team score and attendance.

204 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.618
Was.

205 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:26:19.618 --> 00:26:22.724
Like the.

206 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:26:22.724 --> 00:26:28.894
That number, yeah. Oh, I see, and this is doing COVID took zero, ok. Yeah.

207 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:26:28.894 --> 00:26:40.223
And that's basically it, but I need a whole season 4th data to do this.

208 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:41.922
Oh.

209 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:26:41.922 --> 00:27:00.569
Cause at I used the previous datas e.g. like from this game 25 December I used all of the datas from this to this to the 22 and that ranks each team on a scale.

210 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:27:00.569 --> 00:27:17.309
Of numbers and then that scale of numbers would change as the season goes on and so at the very end of the season, I will have a much more consistent breaking of each team that will make them.

211 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:27:17.309 --> 00:27:22.184
I guess that will make the prediction closer.

212 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:27:22.184 --> 00:27:23.876
Okay.

213 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:34.524
Yeah, but like I feel I don't know if we can pull that large of a data set into the JSON file that we currently have.

214 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:27:34.524 --> 00:27:43.738
Well, I mean, Json could be pretty big. Are you concerned about like the size or like, we don't have enough data?

215 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:27:43.738 --> 00:27:56.101
Not enough data because if you remember, our API calls only calls one game at a time and we only have a thousand calls.

216 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:57.759
Yeah.

217 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:58.398
That's true.

218 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:27:58.398 --> 00:28:04.418
And Does MBA have their things online?

219 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:28:04.418 --> 00:28:09.224
No, this is from like a 2nd handled website.

220 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:28:09.224 --> 00:28:13.340
Yeah MBA really doesn't have.

221 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.844
I have it, but like I don't think they allowed you to download it for free.

222 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:28:18.844 --> 00:28:24.517
That's stupid, ok.

223 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:28:24.517 --> 00:28:44.223
Yeah, so like this is a whole season full of data that's a thousand and a hundred 72 calls. And in order to do that, I don't know if the hoop data supports it, supports auto call function or not, not hook data.

224 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:50.120
You could probably just write like a ******* ball loop to call other games.

225 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.979
That works, but I'm pretty sure that.

226 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:28:53.979 --> 00:28:58.878
The things the API calls, the limited API calls.

227 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:28:58.878 --> 00:29:20.249
It's gonna be issue. Yeah, let me go back.

228 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:29:20.249 --> 00:29:36.629
I think we I guess we can use the game summary part. It's just, it also requires a game ID of it. So if I.

229 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:52.949
Boom, yeah also across the game ID that we didn't know. So what we can really do is just use daily schedule over here.

230 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:29:52.949 --> 00:30:18.393
And then maybe ask for the date, like, is there any game play today? Nope, NO games, NO games today. Nope. Is there any game play this day? There is.

231 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:30:18.393 --> 00:30:22.226
Does it give you the team ID? Oh it does ok.

232 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:30:22.226 --> 00:30:24.687
Yeah, it does.

233 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:30:24.687 --> 00:30:28.265
And then we gotta make separate calls for each game ID.

234 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:30:28.265 --> 00:30:38.720
Oh nah. Yeah, nah. Oh nah. Okay but the whole points and away points are here.

235 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.071
That's kind of crazy and I wasn't like, oh yeah.

236 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:46.336
It is here. It is here.

237 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:30:46.336 --> 00:30:54.371
Do you only need the home and the waypoints?

238 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:30:54.371 --> 00:31:02.178
For like a not so after prediction, yeah. And like the wizards and the away points over here.

239 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:31:02.178 --> 00:31:06.054
I see. Okay, so technically.

240 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:31:06.054 --> 00:31:09.763
Could work. Yeah, technically it could work.

241 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:31:09.763 --> 00:31:21.950
I mean Loki could I'm down to just write a script to do this for me. If you So you just need to, I could do this if you just tell me what data you need.

242 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:27.455
This home points away points, another two team names should be fine.

243 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:31:27.455 --> 00:31:33.543
Yeah, so we have, is it Toyedo, so games ID.

244 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:31:33.543 --> 00:31:36.923
It's due game ID.

245 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:31:36.923 --> 00:31:39.582
The way points? Yeah, but do you know the team from here?

246 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:48.350
Yeah, so it's wait, what is it? Here. Home name wizards, a way name.

247 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:55.046
I see, ok. Okay, yeah, I could, I could write a script through this.

248 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:58.561
Yeah, honestly, in my in my.

249 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:31:58.561 --> 00:32:05.924
Actually, yeah, I'll write a script to do this for me and I'll just make like three ******* support radar accounts or something.

250 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:15.044
Okay. And you just need just need game data? What about like the, what about like the player data? Or you just need to use the old one.

251 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:32:15.044 --> 00:32:16.905
What they.

252 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:32:16.905 --> 00:32:20.742
Yeah. Player data? The player, yeah, player data.

253 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:32:20.742 --> 00:32:22.182
That's a cool.

254 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:32:22.182 --> 00:32:27.203
Good question. I really just use the all player data unless like sports radar.

255 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:32:27.203 --> 00:32:42.408
Gives you ok I mean it can run only on the game data, it can, like it doesn't really need the player data, but the player data makes it more accurate, but I don't think we need that accurate item number yet.

256 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:32:42.408 --> 00:32:48.804
No, the thing is remember how Joshua was talking about how he could bet down Libron James only makes one pocket.

257 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:32:48.804 --> 00:32:53.990
Per game, we can make a separate function, though.

258 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:32:53.990 --> 00:33:00.965
I don't know. I don't know, it seems kind of complex because how are we supposed to know how much ******* scores?

259 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:33:00.965 --> 00:33:12.703
Oh yeah, the problem here is you need it for your ID your ID is required.

260 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:33:14.747 --> 00:33:19.361
I'll see, like.

261 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:33:19.361 --> 00:33:27.202
Yeah, I, I could do the 1st part to get like the games. How much data do you need?

262 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:33:27.202 --> 00:33:36.401
Just the current season, just the current season should be fine. But I don't know when's the season starting though.

263 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:43.645
We're gonna just use like the past, like, I don't know, a hundred like the past year or something. I think I already.

264 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:33:43.645 --> 00:33:51.129
Yeah, let's see.

265 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:53.681
We can't use it to see them.

266 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:33:53.681 --> 00:33:58.045
We can just fake it. We can just fake the pre season part then.

267 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:33:58.045 --> 00:34:01.745
Yeah, we just use some random games.

268 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:34:01.745 --> 00:34:12.127
For like the past. Yeah, like a hundred 80 days or something half a year. Oh, NO, it's still running.

269 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:34:12.127 --> 00:34:14.462
Yeah, please.

270 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:34:14.462 --> 00:34:34.022
Yeah, it's still running, so it's been running. Let me check the schedule. It says there's one yesterday. Oh yeah, there's, it is yesterday.

271 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:34:36.517 --> 00:34:52.664
Yeah, so it is still running, we can we can still do that. I mean, yeah. What I currently just need is just scores team names and I can make a brief I can change it to a brief one.

272 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:34:52.664 --> 00:34:54.755
Okay, I.

273 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:34:54.755 --> 00:35:02.413
Yeah, I'll have I'll still have to figure out how to convert our code to New.

274 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:35:02.413 --> 00:35:08.592
I mean, if you're, are you familiar, are you like still familiar with all.

275 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:35:08.592 --> 00:35:13.556
A year, maybe, two years?

276 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:35:13.556 --> 00:35:22.194
Haven't touched it? Oh ****. I'm using R i'm using I'm using R and bio and that **** sucks.

277 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:35:22.194 --> 00:35:23.991
The four.

278 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:26.711
Thousand course? No 1000.

279 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:35:26.711 --> 00:35:32.790
The 1001. Oh, oh, oh, ok. Oh, yeah. The lab is easy though. That art.

280 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:39.150
It's very easy. Yeah, it's very easy hardware but it's so boring man. I ******* I lose my.

281 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.440
Themselves. I think it's fine.

282 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.992
Now I just hate when Bro makes you collect the data yourself.

283 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:35:46.992 --> 00:35:52.153
Oh yeah, yeah. But.

284 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:35:52.153 --> 00:36:05.671
Can you not give me the CSV? Yeah, ok. Okay, so I guess I'll work on the script. If I have time, I'll do it tomorrow.

285 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:13.612
I'm probably just gonna watch. I'll have to work on I'll have to work on the thing anyways. I have to work on the profile page anyways.

286 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:36:13.612 --> 00:36:23.594
Yeah. Let me know if you need any help with that. Are you gonna, do you have like a, like idea?

287 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:36:23.594 --> 00:36:38.518
Yeah, it's just I'll I'm gonna grab the PHP thing and then do maybe modifications for JavaScript I guess. I think I don't think that's like very annoying.

288 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:36:38.518 --> 00:36:50.771
I think what I think you should do is you add the name to the URL and then you pull from the URL to get the username, and then you make a call to the backend, like there's not.

289 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:36:50.771 --> 00:36:55.098
Make sense? Add the name to the URL. Oh, so like a unique.

290 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:36:55.098 --> 00:37:02.933
URL. Yeah, yeah. So when you click yeah so when you click a user, right? When you click a user on the.

291 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:37:02.933 --> 00:37:20.669
Make it so it redirects them to like/user/the guy's name. And then from there you could probably use JavaScript to pull the URL and extract like the username, then using that username just call the back end.

292 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:37:20.669 --> 00:37:25.873
Just like finding the guy who your name is that. So that way you only need.

293 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:37:25.873 --> 00:37:43.698
The one HTML file? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Makes sense. Yeah, I'll try to do that. But I wanna I wanna add some issues for people that's not here today so that they know what we will.

294 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:37:43.698 --> 00:37:46.255
We're working on. Yeah, we could I'll add some.

295 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:37:46.255 --> 00:37:58.618
I have a leaderboard page link profile and I have a profile page. That's not an issue. It's a that's a project.

296 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:37:58.618 --> 00:38:06.570
I'll also make a issue for the bug.

297 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:13.759
Oh, right, the call again? The prediction page.

298 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:16.332
Yeah, that.

299 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:38:16.332 --> 00:38:18.399
Like overlapping stuff. Yeah.

300 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:38:18.399 --> 00:38:23.090
Oh, it should be using that, the project.

301 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:52.320
I don't even noticed for we should we should do that for like issues. We should put that issue.

302 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:38:52.320 --> 00:39:13.880
Add item. Now.

303 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:25.874
This is my 1st time using.

304 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:39:25.874 --> 00:39:35.465
Whatever I guess NO one actually looks like it except for TA.

305 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:39:35.465 --> 00:39:41.582
I mean it's pretty cool, but why why would you use these over issues I don't know.

306 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:39:46.947 --> 00:39:53.000
So maybe if I see if you have like a big ask.

307 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.668
Project and there's like different teams. A lot of different teams with a lot of different small tasks.

308 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:39:58.668 --> 00:40:02.120
Maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah. So like you don't wanna because issues you.

309 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.921
And group them.

310 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:19.100
Yeah, so they would probably like open different ok yeah that makes sense honestly very script to form data.

311 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:25.581
How can I change this? Edit, I guess.

312 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:32.130
And just will put like a name next to it if you did the thing.

313 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.301
Ah, ok.

314 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:40.293
Yeah, are we still using your logo?

315 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:44.132
Isn't it pronounce? It doesn't matter, it's just a, this isn't.

316 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:40:44.132 --> 00:40:46.915
We can change anytime like yours but.

317 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:40:46.915 --> 00:40:49.056
They're not gonna.

318 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:40:49.056 --> 00:40:55.133
Like NO offense to Pennate, but his like I don't know, it doesn't, it just doesn't match our.

319 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:40:55.133 --> 00:41:25.273
Site yeah. The color theme doesn't really match. I mean mine is just really just generated. I can make it better if I want to hand draw it or change the lines or something, but I don't think it really matters at this point. Yeah, I don't know and he uploaded like on Friday.

320 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:41:25.273 --> 00:41:28.994
Yeah, like right before the presentation.

321 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:41:28.994 --> 00:41:43.139
Yeah, and he uploaded in a very weird name or like a random as random generated name and just put it in index.HTML.

322 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:41:44.996 --> 00:42:18.429
Crazy. Yeah, and I ended up ******* putting it into assets, so I guess what works?

323 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:25.211
Good progress though we're like halfway done. And it's only been.

324 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:42:25.211 --> 00:42:33.897
Semester I guess. If we get Renee and Isaac getting to work, we should be almost done.

325 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:42:33.897 --> 00:42:42.594
Yeah, I remember an intro, we had to do it like we did it like the day before, the week before.

326 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:42:42.594 --> 00:42:44.098
Spring break.

327 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:42:44.098 --> 00:42:58.651
Oh yeah like we just grinded out or not spring break, it was thanksgiving break. Yeah. Like we just grinded that **** out over like four days and we did it in four days. Then we never touched it until the presentation.

328 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:42:58.651 --> 00:43:09.210
I sit with, I sit in with my like team members like at the library for like 8 h per day for a few days interval.

329 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.595
Okay.

330 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:43:10.595 --> 00:43:17.696
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah be like sorry mine, I don't know how to do my part.

331 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:43:17.696 --> 00:43:30.650
Oh, same, I had a, so we had, we were in a group of three and someone else. The other person, she literally committed zero lines of code zero.

332 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:36.455
It's literally zero? Literally nothing real.

333 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:43:36.455 --> 00:43:39.970
And ok but at least did she make the PowerPoint.

334 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:59.612
Well, she was like during present PowerPoint, she was like, hey guys, let's make the PowerPoint and we still had to work on to share ourselves. But I don't know. It was scuffed. Yeah we told her, I remember we told her to like start.

335 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:43:59.612 --> 00:44:02.373
But she was like.

336 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:17.270

339 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:36.670
That that really happened sometime.

340 "Shimu" (1631432192)

Yeah, really good group to see you though. This semester. Yeah.

341 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:44:51.652 --> 00:45:10.770
Okay. Okay.

342 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:30.770
And well I can just assign myself, ok. I'm just assigning myself. Update comment.

343 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:46.260
Yeah try to add some comments to the projects part and just like let them each choose one to work on, I guess.

344 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.480
What else did we talk about that we had people want to do?

345 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:45:50.480 --> 00:46:24.784
Added it on. So one is just utilizing the API API data that we already have description and the profile page that I'll be working on and a main page data insert, so the main page is centerper, add like daily schedule and what's separate function you add? Oh, so another one is the like the actual place where that your points.

346 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:46:24.784 --> 00:46:27.082
Oh, like a.

347 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:46:27.082 --> 00:46:31.706
The actual input. Yeah, like the actual input page where you want to bet your points.

348 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:35.002
That could be in, that has to be.

349 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:46:35.002 --> 00:46:39.966
A separate page. Yeah, that has like yeah like a game page.

350 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:45.720
Yeah, yeah. We should also have a page where we show game data or team data.

351 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.045
And that should be.

352 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:46:48.045 --> 00:46:57.418
The statistics, NO? Yeah, yeah, that could be statistics, but I just want to like when you click on the team, you get to see like the team, the actual team.

353 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:46:57.418 --> 00:46:59.719
I'm reading about it?

354 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:46:59.719 --> 00:47:05.040
And we should do the same thing for our players as well like like.

355 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.762
Like a separate like profile page for each player.

356 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:47:09.878 --> 00:47:11.380
Or like for each team.

357 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:17.401
Yeah, ok. Yeah, that makes sense. Like MBA clear is not like yeah, I know. Get it.

358 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.800
That can be another to do.

359 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.038
Oh, after.

360 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:47:22.038 --> 00:47:46.689
Okay, I'm adding description for the main page.

361 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:47:46.689 --> 00:47:53.080
Because what I wanna implement is, are you familiar with VLR.G?

362 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.386
V L R?

363 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:47:56.386 --> 00:48:12.182
Yeah, VRR.g. It's the it's like a Valerance site. So yeah, take a go to the No NO, It's like Valerant like competitive matches. I don't know if you have them for leap, but.

364 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:48:13.024 --> 00:48:18.083
Okay, I never want to do something for. Yeah, it's like it shows a lot.

365 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:29.310
Yeah, yeah. So like if you click on it, you can see and if you click on a team, they have their own team like statistic page and shift.

366 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:38.530
How does the recent results covered players, rating history.

367 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:42.108
Yeah, so I just want to do something similar to this, but we.

368 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:48:42.108 --> 00:48:52.475
I'll have to copy 141. Okay, the the rating history part is really similar to my data. Like the my my my.

369 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:48:52.475 --> 00:48:55.930
System. Oh ****, nice. And maybe you can.

370 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.955
And like the ratings course I think it's identical.

371 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:49:01.512 --> 00:49:02.411
Oh, that's fine.

372 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:06.308
Yeah, cause we can actually have that bar and it looks really cool.

373 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:49:07.148 --> 00:49:21.651
I just don't have like that. That should be fine, we can use like a framework, I think. Like just search I don't know, chart.js or something and they should have yeah but that's one good thing about web dev. It doesn't get a framework.

374 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:49:21.651 --> 00:49:33.332
Yeah, cause minus also based on a cause this is rating minus also based on the rating for each team and the numbers I think are really similar to each other.

375 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:49:33.332 --> 00:49:39.206
Nice nice. And we just have that like current roster part at the top, you know, something simple.

376 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:49:46.937 --> 00:49:52.647
Is there something for Lee to shut you, right?

377 "Hung, Louis" (2427235584)
00:49:52.647 --> 00:49:56.501

384 "Shimu" (1631432192)
00:50:14.658 --> 00:50:29.474
