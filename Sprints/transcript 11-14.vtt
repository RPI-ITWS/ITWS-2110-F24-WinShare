1 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.128
I just started recording, so let's get this off a roll. Have you guys been able to do any work since yesterday?

2 "Sharma, Pranay" (1904302080)
00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:15.328
Not really, NO. Yeah, NO, I, I was.

3 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:22.248
Able to get my lab done so I was gonna try and focus on this, project a little bit more tomorrow.

4 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.843
Can you feel me in about like a little bit what happened yesterday?

5 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:34.302
Yes, not really, not really much. We were I was, it was mostly just me thinking about my API not working.

6 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:36.320
Ah, ok.

7 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.423
Yeah, so.

8 "izik" (192344064)
00:00:38.423 --> 00:00:42.260
Hey guys, sorry I'm late. I just finished my other meeting.

9 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:00:42.260 --> 00:01:10.727
No worries. We just started recording like 2 min ago. Perfect. Yeah, I was just telling Lewis that basically Hoop data hub, the player IDs are **** to be put it lightly. So if you like search for a player based off of like their name, like Lebron James, and then try to find the player ID in the JSON file, the numbers is blatantly wrong.

10 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:01:10.727 --> 00:01:11.905
A big sense.

11 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:20.490
Yeah. Have you done anything with sports radar yet? Have you tried that? No, NO NO. I was planning on doing that tomorrow. I, I dedicated most of today to get my lab done.

12 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:35.569
Yep. So I haven't have had a chance to really touch it. But yeah, I'm basically gonna take all the data that you and Shebu had put together and I'm gonna go through each team and pull data from each player, from each team.

13 "izik" (192344064)
00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:43.426
All right. Yeah. Tried to see how I did it in teams. And if you need help using the JS, just let me know.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:51.583
Yeah, how how many teams are there? They're like, what, 20 teams in the MBA? 32. ****, ok.

15 "izik" (192344064)
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.932
Yeah, it's a lot. I need to get the logo still, that that's I guess.

16 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:01:57.932 --> 00:02:03.908
Still might be yeah oh Lewis, you're.

17 "izik" (192344064)
00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:21.439
Your pull request, when you change the headers, that fixed the the dropdown window to being like all the same. For whatever reason, I I kinda went through it before you did that. I was just going through it to see if it fixed anything and it just I could not figure out why it was doing it, but how many fixes.

18 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.665
Sure fix.

19 "izik" (192344064)
00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:28.228
So I don't really care. Yeah completely fixed.

20 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:34.871
Yeah yes because we were in my class yesterday, right? And you were just like, Oh ****, it's fixed.

21 "izik" (192344064)
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.390
Yeah, it was so random but now the wor.

22 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:47.270
Yeah, also, I I know he's not here, but she was a God for putting that like file in so that we can automatically update the machine.

23 "izik" (192344064)
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.820
Oh yeah.

24 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.399
Okay, so he have a script present.

25 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:02:50.399 --> 00:03:14.520
Yeah, yeah. So what the push he made yesterday his push basically added a do a file to our GitHub repo that basically allows GitHub to, when you make a merge request, when you merge it, it automatically updates the VM for him. Oh, so that yeah yeah so that way we're not relying on him to update the VM every single time we make a merge request.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.860
Downside, if one of us decides to be a bum above your ************ and break something, it immediately goes down.

27 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.248
I mean always get like like GitHub can always bring us back to the previous version, so I don't think that's that big of it.

28 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:03:30.248 --> 00:03:40.846
Yeah, I'm just I'm just gonna remind us not to be bumpy ************* and politely double check your work. I mean if anyone's gonna break it, it's probably gonna be me, but.

29 "izik" (192344064)
00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:48.468
I've broken things before. It's fine. They're all good.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:55.891
Wait, yeah, also, so once this, this sprint ends basically the beginning of December, right? I think so.

31 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:57.382
Yep.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:03:57.382 --> 00:04:05.967
And then we go right into presentations basically, right? ****, so we got like three weeks. So yeah, we should be fine.

33 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:14.066
The only thing that I'm worried about is, like, how the whole like currency system is not yet set up.

34 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:17.163
Yeah, we can probably I'll probably.

35 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:19.273
Hey Ash.

36 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:04:19.273 --> 00:04:27.689
Do you do you I mean, do we have the SQL tables to set up so that it has points already like as a column?

37 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:36.144
I'm pretty sure that like each player has their own points, but there's NO such thing as column.

38 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:47.486
Okay, so good, well, if the column already exists, all we have to do is implement the PHP scripts for increasing or decreasing.

39 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:50.643
Yes, that's what we need to worry about.

40 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:04:50.643 --> 00:05:02.000
Out right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll try to finish up my stat page in this week soon so that we can all focus on that prediction page.

41 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:24.679
Yeah, cause, for cause I'm currently working about like doing the like wind rate thing and what do you mean, what do you mean wind rate? Like, I have to, I have a script that I'm writing a script to determine like their wind rate or like for like ******* the lakers versus.

42 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:36.879
Each other and that's what I'm currently working on, but I'm not sure if like I don't know how to work on that to the betting system or like the to the current.

43 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:50.387
Well, where is that data gonna be stored like because my question is if you can get that running, what we could do is we could kind of act, use that as like a multiplier for the points like.

44 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:57.491
It can probably be like a JSON file and I use a JS to access it.

45 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:05:57.491 --> 00:06:17.669
Something like that where basically it's like, you, you pull up the data, well you have, you have like the two teams available, you pull up the data a number for like wind probability, the lower the wind probability is more, more is multiplied if it's correct.

46 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:34.883
Probably what we should do for this at least is like go off of static data for the sake of like oh if like like you make a prediction, you get an instantaneous response if you're right or wrong.

47 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:06:34.883 --> 00:06:43.740
But what we're looking at is like data from like games, that's gonna be played in the future, you know?

48 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.564
Okay, ok.

49 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:50.460
Then, yeah, we can we can work, we can make a work around somewhere about that.

50 "izik" (192344064)
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.625
About that one before, like.

51 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:06:53.625 --> 00:07:06.995
During the meetings they guys are not here. The solution that we came up with is like during presentations, we just use like occurred games instead of like new games for a demonstration and be like, oh, we can work on this function and make it available in the future.

52 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:07:06.995 --> 00:07:23.681
Something like that. Yeah, because the only issue is if we do go off of like future games, that means that theoretically the player isn't gonna get a feedback instantaneously if their tradition is right or wrong. And then how do we exactly demo that that feature's there?

53 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:28.003
Yeah yeah that's also like one of the concerns that we had.

54 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:07:28.003 --> 00:07:50.371
Yeah, so that's why I was saying we should probably go off of static data because we can, we can make like an obvious prediction like Lakers beat some really bad team and it goes up by like ten points, but then you say like, that really bad team beats the lakers. Oh, it's gonna go down, it's gonna go down like ten.

55 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:07:50.371 --> 00:07:51.613
Points. Yeah.

56 "izik" (192344064)
00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:55.134
Do you want betting arts?

57 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:07:55.134 --> 00:07:58.717
We, we can.

58 "izik" (192344064)
00:07:58.717 --> 00:08:01.830
There's an API for it.

59 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.394
Okay, that makes sense.

60 "izik" (192344064)
00:08:04.394 --> 00:08:14.961
Dot com. So they can't provide historical odds so we're gonna have to get like fresh games and you get five requests per month.

61 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:22.813
Five? Five, sorry, 500. Oh, oh, ok. Okay, ok.

62 "izik" (192344064)
00:08:22.813 --> 00:08:25.512
Can maybe use that and like rotate around accounts?

63 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:08:25.512 --> 00:08:32.036
Of course. We'll, we'll use like one or two accounts for testing and then for demo, we'll switch over to a fresh account.

64 "izik" (192344064)
00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:49.438
Yep. We can try to use that, and if you want me working on that I can I can do that and try to get data from that because I, I really have nothing besides like getting logos. I think Renee has the CSS done or is gonna do that.

65 "Sharma, Pranay" (1904302080)
00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:52.459
The logos for the teams you're saying?

66 "izik" (192344064)
00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:57.628
Just recolor the pages. Yeah, switching back to the original.

67 "Sharma, Pranay" (1904302080)
00:08:57.628 --> 00:09:10.416
Or like getting yeah yeah NO I'll I'll I'll rehold pages. I'm gonna add the articles to the article page and then I'll also just have the logo on every page as well at the top.

68 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:12.218
Well, that was good.

69 "izik" (192344064)
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:26.891
Yeah, I'll so for me, I was like oh the only thing I was gonna have to do is adding the rest of the logos for the MBA teams, and like since we were talking more predictions, I was just like well let's just get a sports betting API down.

70 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:09:26.891 --> 00:09:41.899
Yeah, yeah, definitely do some research on that and if we could talk about that as a group as a whole with shemo, she move here on Friday. We can kind of get a good idea of like what we need to tackle for that last, for the prediction part.

71 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:43.639
Yeah, definitely.

72 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:44.440
Yeah.

73 "izik" (192344064)
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.689
Yeah, it doesn't look that bad, and I'm looking through Oh wait, is it in Python?

74 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:52.019
**** is it? Hopefully not Python.

75 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:59.757
And another thing we have to do is the friends function cause that's what Calvan mentioned last time during our mid semester pres.

76 "izik" (192344064)
00:09:59.757 --> 00:10:02.669
Oh, that's hard.

77 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:06.796
Yeah, our idea, like.

78 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:16.934
Last time I talked with like right now is that we have like a username and then the username corresponds to in another table with the list of threads.

79 "izik" (192344064)
00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:19.590
And the friends.

80 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:27.858
Like, you get your own like friend leadership leaderboard instead of like the whole leaderboard on your main page. That's good, yeah.

81 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:33.213
Yeah, if, and if that's loaded dynamically that can save a speed.

82 "izik" (192344064)
00:10:33.213 --> 00:10:54.973
And stuff like do you should we also count the amount of we can have the static data because like a lot of this doesn't I remember you saying that a lot of it doesn't have to be like actually real. A lot of it can just be like really static data. So we can have for the tables, we can have the amount of matches you bet on, so we can count that, we can count the amount of points you have, your wind weight loss.

83 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:10:54.973 --> 00:11:01.946
Show your Yeah that was that like all of that was kind of, ok, let me show you the data structure that we have.

84 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:11:01.946 --> 00:11:05.810
Right now. Yeah.

85 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:23.219
This is the exempt right now, so the admin, there's points, there's rounds correct, there's rounds wrong, and then if I go to the where's my if I go, is it this one? It's this one.

86 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:11:23.219 --> 00:11:40.195
Yeah. Okay, so if I go to the profile page, if I log in, and the profile page shows your score and your wind rate, your correct rounds, your total rounds, and stuff like that. And we can add it in theme.

87 "izik" (192344064)
00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:42.071
Yeah. Perfect.

88 "izik" (192344064)
00:11:42.813 --> 00:11:48.128
Yeah, and that way we can each have our own account and then have our friends and then we can show that as like our demo.

89 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:11:48.128 --> 00:11:59.460
So like fake data? Yeah, that would be perfect, but like the what is now what is now done is this. This is like the global leadership data.

90 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:16.576
Yeah, and then all we need is just some kind of, at least for the predictions, like if you go to prediction page, if you can click that real quick, like, yeah, you just click on the games and then you can probably what we can do here is we can just predict like which team is gonna win, at least right now.

91 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:18.478
Yeah.

92 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:12:18.478 --> 00:12:22.898
And then, yeah, you can get points based off of that.

93 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:12:22.898 --> 00:12:27.214
That's where we're the 1st step that we need to do though.

94 "izik" (192344064)
00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:31.442
Where would our analysis come through?

95 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:12:31.442 --> 00:12:32.764
What now.

96 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:12:32.764 --> 00:13:04.458
We we can say that like we think this team has a X amount X cancer winning and then well, I don't know exactly because at least with your statistics Lewis, we'll have some kind of wind probability. So the question is, is do we display that exact wind probability or should we like also have like a small function that like randomizes it a little bit?

97 "izik" (192344064)
00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:06.903
I think we should make it static.

98 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:08.294
Yeah, let's.

99 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:13:08.294 --> 00:13:31.175
Yeah. Like what we should do is like we should run like a wind rate between all of the teams and then just like put the wind rate right there be like we think like atlantic hops versus the hornets that there's a 63 % that the hops will win and like a ******* 34 % at the hornets will win.

100 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:13:31.175 --> 00:13:39.065
Yeah, then we go in there and then we have some kind of multiplier based off of the probability.

101 "izik" (192344064)
00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:55.499
Honestly, what we could do is it's kind of a little cheat, but, so we can have all the games like up to date updated for like bedding odds and all the games, and we can use the odds that we are, that we have.

102 "izik" (192344064)
00:13:55.499 --> 00:14:12.689
For that day, let's say, and have it updated every day and say whichever team has the better odds, just make a function and have like a percentage and it they don't, NO one has to know about us that that is how we have analysis that could just be it.

103 "izik" (192344064)
00:14:12.689 --> 00:14:30.898
Because like our project was analysis as well. I don't know if, I I know Callan is only grading on like the actual code itself is not gonna be great, he's not grill where he's not grading on like actually, performance, like part of our part of our group is also analysis.

104 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:14:30.898 --> 00:14:53.514
Oh, and also we don't really have much. Just as a warning for you guys, for Lewis since you and have set up the PHP stuff so far, when you're dealing with pulling stuff from the table, if you guys can try to use like prepare statements because are really good at stopping SQL SQL exemp.

105 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:14:53.514 --> 00:14:55.242
Options. Okay.

106 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:14:55.242 --> 00:15:15.403
Okay, so in the PHP code itself, you can look this up online, but it's just like statement point like arrow prepare, and basically what it does is it it kind of tells the PHP code that whatever you're inputting should not be interpreted as like pure SQL code, but rather just plain text.

107 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:15:15.403 --> 00:15:35.789
Okay, so, wait, I can't find new psvs. It's mostly config. Wait not in config. So like if we look at leaders board page, like you mean these.

108 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:15:35.789 --> 00:15:41.364
Yeah, you see how the right below it, it just says connection query S.

109 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:15:41.364 --> 00:15:44.168
Yep.

110 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:15:44.168 --> 00:16:00.147
You should probably look online I can probably try and send you a link or two about like prepare statements, but it's just basically just whenever you input something into a table or take it out from the table, you should prepare it.

111 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:02.800
Do we need to prepare while we take it out?

112 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:11.346
Because every all I'm doing here is taking it out. I don't think you need to. I think it's good practice in like the real world to do that, but for our case I don't think you need.

113 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:22.651
Yeah cause like I don't see where we can really just like type in something and send it to our PHP myadmin because that's not a thing in the program.

114 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:24.306
Yeah, yeah.

115 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:16:24.306 --> 00:16:31.211
Oh wait, it is. It's in the login page, ok.

116 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:16:31.211 --> 00:16:41.829
Just login, here. Sign up, I guess.

117 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:47.488
Yeah, it's called Prepare and bind. I'll send you a link through discord.

118 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:16:47.488 --> 00:16:51.731
Okay, I'll make sure I take a note down who's that.

119 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:16:51.731 --> 00:17:07.433
Yeah, yeah. It it's just basically saying like I should be expecting this kind of input and output and just kind of, does a good job at stopping people from being malicious.

120 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:17:07.433 --> 00:17:09.776
Okay.

121 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:17:09.776 --> 00:17:14.452
Okay, let me I should have just sent it to you person.

122 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:17:14.452 --> 00:17:16.435
Emily. Yep. Okay found it.

123 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:28.389
Yeah yeah it's it's relatively simple. It just before you do the query, you just kind of prepare it based off of what you're gonna put in.

124 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:17:28.389 --> 00:17:33.396
Gotcha, ok. I was just writing that in case I forgot.

125 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:17:33.396 --> 00:17:48.211
Yeah, it's it's called the prepare statement. So it's yeah you do like a prepare statement which binds values and then send that then then you input your variables and query it.

126 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:51.374
Okay.

127 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:17:51.374 --> 00:17:55.890
Yeah, it's just basically that, prepared bind statement.

128 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:01.948
Where it says like insert into this. Okay.

129 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:18:01.948 --> 00:18:07.344
Yeah, I did I did that for my lab and it stopped all SQL injections on the zapp score.

130 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:18:07.344 --> 00:18:10.845
Okay, then.

131 "izik" (192344064)
00:18:10.845 --> 00:18:13.967
It makes sense where we should do it.

132 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:22.228
Yeah, I'm just I'm emphasizing that because Callihan is the information security IT professor.

133 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:18:22.228 --> 00:18:24.560
Yeah, so.

134 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.727
If we lack security features, he's gonna get.

135 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:18:27.727 --> 00:18:35.668
That mad yeah we should do that, yeah. Okay.

136 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:18:35.668 --> 00:18:43.829
Yeah. So with that said, I think we're all good. I will try to finish up my, at least the player side of the.

137 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:18:43.829 --> 00:19:03.829
Predictions page this week, and then we could all start, and then Isaac with the logos and then Renee with the color, the colored template and then we'll all kind of, once we get done with this week, we'll all kind of pivot towards the prediction page to make sure that's done because that's where our.

138 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:06.327
The Main functionality lies.

139 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:19:06.327 --> 00:19:13.887
Yeah, I think we just have like all of the other random stuff done. Now we just have to do the main functionality part.

140 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:19:13.887 --> 00:19:21.092
Yeah, not even that like we have all the cool, well, we have all the cool features that makes the main functionality look great.

141 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:19:21.092 --> 00:19:23.378
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:29.654
Yeah, and the main functionality itself is only like 20 % of the websites, which is good. Fair enough, I'll work on the.

143 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:19:29.654 --> 00:19:31.098
Friends function at least try to work.

144 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:19:31.098 --> 00:19:38.877
Got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You, you work on the friends function and then we'll all try to get that, the prediction stuff running.

145 "Hung, Louis" (3732433152)
00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:40.013
Okay.

146 "Collins, Joshua" (1808401664)
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:46.313
Okay yeah and with that said, I think we are done.

147 "izik" (192344064)
00:19:46.313 --> 00:19:50.619
Perfect. Anyone else have any other questions before?

148 "izik" (192344064)
00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:52.590
Now from my side.

149 "Sharma, Pranay" (1904302080)
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.336
Think I think I'm good. I'm good.
