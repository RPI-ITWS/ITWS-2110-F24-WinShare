1 "shimu" (229590528)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
If Joshua joins you will join.

2 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.643
If he does it, that's fine. That's fine.

3 "shimu" (229590528)
00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:25.561
Okay, maybe we should talk about what we did so far per project so for me, I made the sign up page and I, so in my basically my branch, I turned all the HTML files into PHP.

4 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.808
And started working on the sign up page.

5 "shimu" (229590528)
00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:35.843
So good news is sign up works so far, is able to put a user in the database, which is good.

6 "shimu" (229590528)
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:50.742
I'm gonna try to get login working by the end of this week, if not next week. And I will also try to figure out how to use cookies with the login, but that should be pretty straightforward after I implement login.

7 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:52.590
Can I help?

8 "shimu" (229590528)
00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:11.136
Only thing I'm worried about is after I merge back, I merge back my branch into main, I the conflict's gonna be crazy row cause I I literally made everything PHP and yeah, it's not gonna be fun. Yeah, ok.

9 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:37.194
I guess I'll start with mine then. I made the prediction page, like just a general out layout, but I guess I'll share it a bit. So it looks like this for now, and these logos, I put it all in my folder over here. So I I put all of the logos in here just so that we can have it easier.

10 "shimu" (229590528)
00:01:37.194 --> 00:01:37.834
Oh!

11 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:46.578
Okay nice. No, I didn't push it yet, but they're all PNG, so like NO background. Nice, nice.

12 "shimu" (229590528)
00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:49.416
I was just about asked do we have backgrounds? No.

13 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:58.534
No, NO backgrounds. And I think they're all, ok, most of them are squares. I'll all switch out the ones that's not squares.

14 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:01:58.534 --> 00:02:01.772
Just so like it will look better on this page. Yeah.

15 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:06.987
So one thing though, are we gonna put these pictures in our database?

16 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:06.987 --> 00:02:17.666
I don't think we need. We just just do like a quick, what's it called again? Just, just do a quick like data like path reference.

17 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:21.607
Yeah, I was about to say we can't we shouldn't put this in our database.

18 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:27.410
Yeah, like the path reference should be fine because I I just put it in assets.

19 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.748
Hi cool.

20 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:33.323
Yeah. And then, oh yeah, I also did this.

21 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:36.205
Oh, you got the logo as well? Okay, that's cool. Yeah.

22 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:39.310
This is just Delhi generated.

23 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.085
It looks nice though. Yeah.

24 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:43.643
And I took out the background on this one.

25 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:43.643 --> 00:02:47.328
Okay, I think we're gonna use this and not for this.

26 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:48.707
Yeah, cause.

27 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:51.305
I don't even know where he is man. Yeah.

28 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.689
I mean it's already on my branch so I can just push it anytime. Yeah.

29 "shimu" (229590528)
00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.845
It looks it looks really nice as well. I think it matches our aesthetic with all like this.

30 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:02.265
The color theme I chose like specifically.

31 "shimu" (229590528)
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.101
It really matches our aesthetic.

32 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:28.204
Yeah and what else did I do? Not much here. Oh yeah, and the and the stats page that you guys saw. Wait, this is not working. Let me open it up again. Leaderboard page, yeah. And this JS.

33 "shimu" (229590528)
00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:32.237
I still can't go over how cool the score is the loading.

34 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:03:32.237 --> 00:03:37.486
Yeah, the score is, it took me a while to figure it out, but it's fine.

35 "shimu" (229590528)
00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:38.476
It looks nice.

36 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:48.903
Yeah, we just have to switch the, these two buttons. Yeah. No, these are already implemented. It's just the CSS has now changed.

37 "shimu" (229590528)
00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:50.802
Oh, I see ok. Yeah.

38 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:03:50.802 --> 00:03:56.137
And I I think I have made the data so like player one has the highest win rate blah blah blah and goes down.

39 "shimu" (229590528)
00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:59.339
Oh, ok, ok, I see. Yeah.

40 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.098
The only problem is this. This is the only.

41 "shimu" (229590528)
00:04:02.098 --> 00:04:13.481
It should be fine. I don't know what happened, but I hope it's it's an easy fix. You could probably give that thing on the inside. You see that like box?

42 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.785
A lower Z index.

43 "shimu" (229590528)
00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:22.637
Yeah, like this con this content. Oh, really? Have you tried giving it a lowers D index?

44 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:55.674
Nope, it should be should be this one this should be a right column, it should be this one was the index? I know cause what I did here for this CSS is I just used the main page CSS, so I don't know what's wrong. But that should be something something weird is probably happening. I don't know maybe Isaac can fix that because I'm not I didn't look into the app bar yet.

45 "shimu" (229590528)
00:04:55.674 --> 00:04:58.075
That that could just be a bug that we fixed later.

46 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:03.517
Yeah, but like overall this leaderboard works and we just have to do like the CSS for the page.

47 "shimu" (229590528)
00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:04.830
Yeah.

48 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:20.785
And that's basically it for me. Oh yeah, and another problem that I figured out. So if you want to grab, this is the use, so if we want to grab a gay, e.g..

49 "shimu" (229590528)
00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:22.106
We have to.

50 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:26.756
Now the game ID.

51 "shimu" (229590528)
00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:42.728
What is like the game ID formatted into? Like that? Yeah. Is it arbitrary or is this like, is there like a game that is the same number but last digit is four?

52 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:05:42.728 --> 00:05:51.970
I don't know, I haven't tried the API call yet because I'm pretty sure this is the shell version. This is not the PHP version.

53 "shimu" (229590528)
00:05:51.970 --> 00:06:05.426
This might be a problem, but usually there should be like a API that gives you like the most recent like ten games and you get game ID and you usually use the game ID to get like the game data.

54 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:11.630
Yeah? Or NO? No.

55 "shimu" (229590528)
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.104
Aha.

56 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:37.689
So, the thing that I wanted, like the, I guess replacement solution that I come up with is I found another API because this was rated I didn't share it yet, but you can see when I do daily schedule, ****, forgotten about this.

57 "shimu" (229590528)
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:43.503
Sport radar. Yeah.

58 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:58.509
If I do this, this is giving you like the dates and what games there are today and at home points or way points.

59 "shimu" (229590528)
00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:07.009
Oh, ok. I think this is better because we should probably update the games every day. We should get like daily games and stuff.

60 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:24.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, so this is like, I don't know, some kind of replacement that I come up with, but I'm not cause this API only allows you to do I think 1000 or something like that per trial and per trial is like one month.

61 "shimu" (229590528)
00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:27.710
Oh, what the ****? Okay, that's really, that's really low.

62 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.649
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So.

63 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:51.649
So we either use this, like, cause we all at least have like two emails. So we either use this with a lot of different free email accounts or we can just use this to call the daily schedules and then use that info to put in the Hoop data hub, which gives us.

64 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:55.271
It's a much longer trial and much more tries.

65 "shimu" (229590528)
00:07:55.271 --> 00:08:07.167
The problem might be, the problem could be that data hub stores the data differently from the other API. We don't know if they'll interact with each other correctly.

66 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:13.248
Okay, but if the, if the name, if the name's the same, it's the same.

67 "shimu" (229590528)
00:08:13.248 --> 00:08:15.391
Oh, I guess so, yeah.

68 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:36.032
Yeah, like if the team name appears the same, it's the same. And we don't really have to make them interact because this might only be for the prediction page. That doesn't have to be for the stats page. I don't know I'm just giving you ideas. Yeah.

69 "shimu" (229590528)
00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:41.055
The thing is really weird. How are we supposed to get game ID?

70 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:08:41.055 --> 00:08:54.872
Oh, yeah, NO, that's my question because I was looking over it today at.

71 "shimu" (229590528)
00:08:54.872 --> 00:09:02.233
But for all these games, for all these like other calls you do need game ID.

72 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:22.441
Yeah, like to get a game you need the game ID, but you don't know what's the game ID at the 1st point, so it's making really weird, so we can either just go in, we can just go into this quarter and ask for help or we can, I don't know, use the sports radar API.

73 "shimu" (229590528)
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:36.509
Yeah. Oh wait, can I let me find, let me try to see something.

74 "shimu" (229590528)
00:09:57.539 --> 00:10:11.814
Yeah, actually I don't I just I was just going through it this whole day.

75 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:27.982
Yeah, I, I went for multiple times, I don't see the MIDs anywhere.

76 "shimu" (229590528)
00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:33.896
Do you have an API right now? Do you have the API or authorization?

77 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:10:33.896 --> 00:10:38.531
Thing? Oh NO, I didn't I didn't do any API stuff. Yeah.

78 "shimu" (229590528)
00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:57.393
Let me try something Alright, how do you get your authorization key? Oh, it's right here.

79 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:10:57.393 --> 00:10:59.177
Book data hub?

80 "shimu" (229590528)
00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:21.269
Yeah, let me let me try to access it just to see what it looks like. Yeah, yeah, we do need to do that.

81 "shimu" (229590528)
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:36.269
Oh, I need my laptop because Windows can't do this apparently.

82 "shimu" (229590528)
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:55.199
Okay data hub.

83 "shimu" (229590528)
00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:32.211
When you gotta go, by the way?

84 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:37.128
When my roommate come back.

85 "shimu" (229590528)
00:12:37.128 --> 00:12:39.272
Okay.

86 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:40.433
So.

87 "shimu" (229590528)
00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:57.649
I might have to go in like 5 min, so I'll just try this out real quick and if it works, it works.

88 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:09.554
I mean if it doesn't work, we'll always have the other things for replacement.

89 "shimu" (229590528)
00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:21.532
Game ID parameters required, ok? Yeah, I don't know there's NO way they expected the users without knowing what the game ID is.

90 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:13:21.532 --> 00:13:31.358
Yeah, cause usually there, they will give you like the games I don't know, access the way through the parameters of the game ID.

91 "shimu" (229590528)
00:13:31.358 --> 00:13:38.515
Yeah, there should be should be like the API call that gives you the game IDs.

92 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:13:38.515 --> 00:13:46.361
Yeah, but I don't see it in here so that's what makes me frustrated, I guess.

93 "shimu" (229590528)
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:55.079
Maybe the players have a list of IDs, scheme IDs? No. Oh, there's a team ID.

94 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:59.720
Yeah, but team ID, I don't think it correlates with the game ID.

95 "shimu" (229590528)
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:28.915
Yep, you're right. That doesn't give you anything.

96 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:14:28.915 --> 00:14:39.077
Well.

97 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:45.241
Yeah, this is a problem that we should probably fix.

98 "shimu" (229590528)
00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:59.735
I, this is so weird man.

99 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:14:59.735 --> 00:15:19.027
I really don't know how to do this. Yeah.

100 "shimu" (229590528)
00:15:19.027 --> 00:15:24.078
How does the rest of these need a game with you?

101 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:25.580
Sorry?

102 "shimu" (229590528)
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:31.080
The rest of the APIs need a game ID. It just doesn't have a way to give you.

103 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.004
That's only this one.

104 "shimu" (229590528)
00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:43.175
No, NO, I meant like maybe see the like all time and event stats, videos, they require like a game ID for it to function.

105 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:45.626
Oh, we can't use that.

106 "shimu" (229590528)
00:15:45.626 --> 00:15:48.557
Oh, the one was started.

107 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:15:48.557 --> 00:15:54.438
That's prime is pre it's premium? That's crazy again.

108 "shimu" (229590528)
00:15:54.438 --> 00:15:59.615
Bro that's crazy. All right. No other sure.

109 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:15:59.615 --> 00:16:01.357
Yeah, sure we met.

110 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:08.346
I think it would be better off using the the reschedule of this one.

111 "shimu" (229590528)
00:16:08.346 --> 00:16:11.120
Yeah, we should probably find your API.

112 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:22.423
Yeah, I mean I'll send it in the group chat 1st for now just so everyone get access to it.

113 "izik" (483486976)
00:16:22.423 --> 00:16:27.339
Is it just for basketball or is it at all the sports?

114 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:32.060
I'm pretty sure it's for all the sports. Yeah sweet.

115 "izik" (483486976)
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.259
We can even expand if we, we want.

116 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:38.881
Now we can put in our presentation that there's more room to expand.

117 "izik" (483486976)
00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:42.295
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

118 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:16:42.295 --> 00:16:58.516
But this, this only gives you like one month with 1000 calls for each free trial, so we'll have to switch our emails up.

119 "izik" (483486976)
00:16:58.516 --> 00:17:19.677
****, forgot about homework. Oh NO.

120 "shimu" (229590528)
00:17:28.083 --> 00:17:32.215
They expect people to pay for this when it doesn't work. Well.

121 "shimu" (229590528)
00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:45.816
I'm trying to join a discourse one that says the employee expired, expired.

122 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:17:45.816 --> 00:17:54.243
Oh my god.

123 "shimu" (229590528)
00:17:54.243 --> 00:18:03.955
This thing is so expensive as well. 0.0 $0.05 per request, but that's like the open AI API.

124 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:18:03.955 --> 00:18:08.534
I don't think you'd even need to pay for the open air API.

125 "shimu" (229590528)
00:18:08.534 --> 00:18:12.694
Like to use the API you pay like couples today.

126 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:18:12.694 --> 00:18:27.860
Oh, really? Wait, NO. I called the API like, I called it through, what's called again? There's an automation thing that I called the open AI API through and it doesn't cost me anything.

127 "shimu" (229590528)
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.919
I really.

128 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:46.042
Yeah, I did that like, I don't know, two, two or three months ago and didn't cost me anything or it just might be the company the company I'm interning have like supreme membership to everything.

129 "shimu" (229590528)
00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.158
Maybe they have some credit maybe.

130 "shimu" (229590528)
00:18:48.797 --> 00:19:01.089
Yeah but I remember when I 1st used like the GPT three API I had to pay like a couple cents per use per call basically. Oh, yeah.

131 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:19:01.089 --> 00:19:10.273
Makes sense though.

132 "shimu" (229590528)
00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:22.352
Yeah, we should probably find a new MBA if that, if the one if we ok so sport radar is good, it looks good but low usage.

133 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:19:22.352 --> 00:19:41.929
I mean one is the same as the data hub. Yeah cause it's it's just like per it's just one month. So like we just have to replace, make a new account with the email. Well, we at least have two emails, so we just have to make a new account.

134 "shimu" (229590528)
00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:49.150
At this point, yeah, which is put like ten different emails ten K usage.

135 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:54.728
Yeah, and there's only two months left, so I I think it will work.

136 "shimu" (229590528)
00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:59.373
You know like the day before presentation, we just make a new account.

137 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:19:59.373 --> 00:20:01.515
Yeah.

138 "shimu" (229590528)
00:20:01.515 --> 00:20:15.850
Okay, I think we should use sport radar because I was just checking it out and this seems pretty good. Most important thing is you could get the games being played in one day.

139 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.750
Yeah, that's like one of the crucial things that we.

140 "shimu" (229590528)
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.827
Actually yeah that that's one thing we have to support.

141 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:20:22.827 --> 00:20:29.131
Yeah. Okay, I guess we're good then.

142 "shimu" (229590528)
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:33.892
Yeah, and I do have to go so do you guys wanna have a meeting?

143 "Hung, Louis" (4088636928)
00:20:33.892 --> 00:20:37.517
Yeah, I'll just end the meeting. Sure.

144 "shimu" (229590528)
00:20:37.517 --> 00:20:40.450
Thank you. Alright, see you. See you.

145 "izik" (483486976)
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.504
Yeah, so.
