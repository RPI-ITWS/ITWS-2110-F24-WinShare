00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.303
Recording, yeah, we have to set up a meeting with Calluhan to basically discuss like what we've done so far. So that's why I was kind of like, that's why I sent you the text earlier, like, make sure you push all your stuff because when we have a meeting with Calluhan and he just sees like what we.

2 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:00:17.303 --> 00:00:21.430
Currently have, I don't know how happy he will be.

7 "izik" (376830720)
00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:52.529
Where are you currently on the login page? Have you started? Yeah, I have. I literally like I just started like during the meeting. I have the bootstrap done. I'm just trying to implement the nav bar to keep it the same.

8 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:00:52.529 --> 00:01:03.810
Sort of style, NO worries, you can change the, change the CSS on the nav barge and make it or like in the layout to make it work, but if if it just follows that general.

9 "izik" (376830720)
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:19.668
The idea of we can even copy it over to other web pages. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't get it to stay in front and like or on top and then like lay it out cause like the bootstrap is just gonna kinda weird. I'm having to figure that one out, but.

10 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:25.303
But now I have that. It's in my branch if you want to take a look at it, but. Yeah, I'll take a look later. I just need to finish up the.

11 "izik" (376830720)
00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:32.938
Last my refresh button on my lab and yeah I mentioned to the lab, the mitre. My MITRE thing is killing me.

12 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:42.374
So I have so much to do this week. It's crazy. No worries bro. It's just, I'll send him a message to.

13 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:01:42.374 --> 00:01:46.695
How do you think we should message him about the, the meeting? I'm pretty sure he can.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:48.453
We can meet with the tas.

15 "izik" (376830720)
00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:51.479
Yeah, I'll I'll.

16 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:10.033
That's the TA. We can ask them in our. Oh yeah yeah I'll send a message to them after this call so we can figure that out. Cause I Yeah, ideally we just need to find a time that works for most of us so we can talk about it. And we need Pranay to get his updated logo into the website as well somewhere.

17 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.935
When do you want to do it?

18 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:19.273
I said he wasn't available during this week. I know, but we just have to get a request in.

19 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:27.151
By the end of this week. It doesn't have to be this week, but yeah cause I remember he said something about like free on Saturdays or Sundays.

20 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:33.814
I don't know if that's a good idea though. I I'm I'm I'm not available this Sunday.

21 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:02:33.814 --> 00:02:36.791
Because my mom's coming up because Monday's my day.

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:49.013
Oh, so air 24? Oh.

25 "izik" (376830720)
00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:51.065
Okay, I i'm almo i'm almost.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:57.008
Class. Yeah, you're all three. I'm almost all three. Yeah. Respect.

27 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:02:57.008 --> 00:02:59.529
Oh, Lewis is in the impa.

28 "izik" (376830720)
00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.966
I am O five.

29 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:03.936
It's.

30 "izik" (376830720)
00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:07.213
Yeah, but.

31 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:39.030
Are you in college shortly? Yeah, so you're still working on the, the login and sign up pages. I'm gonna start working on I'll start getting the layoff of the statistics websit, the statistics webpage this week and next week. So my my idea is just, you know, get HTML and CSS set up. We can then set up the databases and the API statistic. Well, set up databases and set up API and start to understand what the API needs from us and what we can get from it.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:54.788
And then after that we can then start implementing the API with like going into databases and doing certain things, like, then we can kind of expand from there, get some base functionality and then once we get done with that, we can then start adding cool features.

33 "izik" (376830720)
00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:57.630
Okay.

34 "izik" (376830720)
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:15.360
Okay. Yeah, I I can share my screen of what it looks like right now. Okay. And I'll show you guys my issue. Let me just do that. I'll do it. Let me do this, how do I do this? I'm just gonna do the entire screen. Yeah, you're you're good.

35 "izik" (376830720)
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:36.530
Okay wait. Oh, there you go. Alright, good? Yeah, we can see you. Yep. So, yeah, it's just it's such a simple bootstrap, but yeah, I'm trying to get this in. So if I include, if I include that in, which is the other, the, the main pace CSS.

36 "izik" (376830720)
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:49.631
It's just, it it yeah it it doesn't even I don't even know what to say about this. So I'm gonna have to figure that out, but I moved, I moved the.

37 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:50.970
Login page.

38 "izik" (376830720)
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.265
More the login stuff into a separate folder. Oh yeah, That's what we have as our site map.

39 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:05.793
So that's fine. Yeah, it's literally just basic. Yeah, but this is right here. I mean, there shouldn't be a problem with the main navigation.

40 "izik" (376830720)
00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:07.706
Bar and, and your code, right.

41 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.330
Hey, I mean it's doing the.

42 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:20.106
All right, so I don't know. It might be like one of your classes or like overlapping names. It might be a display for a flex box being displayed as like a co a.

43 "izik" (376830720)
00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:31.875
Column instead of a row, and what? And in this and make CSS. Oh in main CSS.

44 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:34.311
I don't know I didn't change it. I just I added a new.

45 "izik" (376830720)
00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:36.511
Okay.

46 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:53.790
Yeah, I mean, that's all I did. Okay. Yeah, yeah, we we definitely play around with that and just kind of find, here's a good thing, at least everything else is looking good. We can we can fix that. We we can change the way that that nav bar works so that it's, it works on your page.

47 "izik" (376830720)
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.514
We can copy over to other pages.

48 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:05:56.514 --> 00:06:04.146
Yeah, yeah. Cause let's be honest with you having a solid understanding of bootstrap, you're probably gonna be the.

49 "izik" (376830720)
00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:10.654
CS CSS CSS God. I mean, look, I I just.

50 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:16.134
Figured out how to use bootstrap like an hour ago. Right, but I mean it's not that bad.

51 "izik" (376830720)
00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:21.694
Literally just copy and paste everything. Yeah.

52 "izik" (376830720)
00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:35.164
I don't know. We'll, we'll just see how it goes, I mean, I mean, I think all it is, all it is is literally, you add these two things right here, in the header and then you copy and paste.

53 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:06:35.164 --> 00:06:36.550
There is.

54 "izik" (376830720)
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:43.150
HTML, this, this is the entire HTML right here. Yeah, and that's it. All I did to add, to make it centered and I.

55 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:53.830
Add the container and then add it this Would it be possible of like what's conflicting the navigation bar on your.

56 "izik" (376830720)
00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:11.599
Login pages, the bootstrap import. That that's my concern, which is gonna be really, really annoying for me to fix, but we can possibly change it so that we can use.

57 "izik" (376830720)
00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.710
It's a nav bar from bootstrap. I think I can, there should be.

58 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.652
E navors in.

59 "izik" (376830720)
00:07:20.652 --> 00:07:32.807
Yeah, and it can look something if we can find something that is useful NO, I mean.

60 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:43.971
We can change this out. Yeah, of course, but we can find something maybe. We can just style that around but like if we really want to like keep everything in the uniform situation, then we can.

61 "izik" (376830720)
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:48.545
Like we might as well use bootstrap nat bars. Yeah, are we allowed.

62 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:07:48.545 --> 00:08:03.329
We're allowed to use it, right? Yeah. If we want to keep things working, just use it. Yeah, I think we're better off using it because it, it bootstrap bootstraps are are made by professional front end developers, so.

63 "izik" (376830720)
00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:19.528
By taking advantage of that, it's just gonna make our website look more clean. This looks so much nicer, yeah. You can all see my 97 tabs that I have open wild for a minor. Yeah, this is a preview of what you guys are gonna, if you're a PM.

64 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:08:19.528 --> 00:08:20.928
This is a quick.

65 "izik" (376830720)
00:08:20.928 --> 00:08:28.063
Preview of what you guys have to do. Wow. Young. It's, it's yeah it's pretty bad.

66 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:08:28.063 --> 00:08:32.675
That's if you're a project manager, but yeah, anyways, I'm not.

67 "izik" (376830720)
00:08:32.675 --> 00:08:49.079
It's gonna be a project manager. I don't have the time to do that. It it NO it's honestly not that bad like all you do for right now is you just work on this is, this is very tedious. This sucks because you have to click on every single like you have to make 70 to a hundred tasks.

68 "izik" (376830720)
00:08:49.079 --> 00:09:07.289
So we have to add a few more. We have to click on everyone, go into settings advanced, and then you have to click fixed duration and uncheck that. And that's every single one. That is the most annoying fucking part. I hated it so much and they go through and change all the hours, but. Okay.

69 "izik" (376830720)
00:09:07.289 --> 00:09:22.084
It's it's just so tedious and like NO one follows this. It it's usually just done on Excel or like a flow chart, and it's like, it takes like a day to do it. I don't know why we're for Like I guess some.

70 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:39.364
Older companies use Gantter but whatever yeah but yeah I I think we're in a good spot. We should definitely focus on including Renee and on what our plans are. I think Lewis are.

71 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:09:39.364 --> 00:09:44.435
I forgot what were you supposed to do for the main page? I I'm doing.

72 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:49.985
Here on the left side, like the leaderboard part? Oh yeah. Oh Yeah CSS.

73 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:57.883
Yeah, do you have time to work on that tomorrow by by any chance? I mean, possibly cause right now I'm focusing on my.

74 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:09:57.883 --> 00:10:00.236
My lab. So like once I finish my lab.

75 "izik" (376830720)
00:10:00.236 --> 00:10:02.081
I'll just have to work on that. Yeah.

76 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:19.100
Focus on your. Yeah, I can just tell you guys, it's basically just a shit ton of PHP. Like you're gonna turn your main, you had to turn your main page into an index or into a PHP, and then it's, the way I'm using a bunch of.

77 "izik" (376830720)
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.703
Host calls, which basically means like if I have a s if I.

78 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:10:23.703 --> 00:10:49.980
I have the Yeah, it took me so just I I did my lab for 2 h like two days ago, and my issue came from the fact that I had an exit call in one of the PHP files I included and I didn't see it. So when it was like half done, so none of the none of the HTML loaded, so I I just got fucked and I was like, what's going on? And there's like.

79 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.385
This little exit code at the bottom of.

80 "izik" (376830720)
00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:58.201
Like fuck. Wow. Yeah, I'm actually I'm not even using.

81 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:09.242
Oh, really? I don't think I have it once. Yeah, well right now my index of PHP is 220 lines. API updates 55 lines.

82 "izik" (376830720)
00:11:09.242 --> 00:11:11.964
API fetches 55 lines.

83 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:11:11.964 --> 00:11:15.040
Yeah, NO, it's it's.

84 "izik" (376830720)
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:25.500
It's also 55 lines. I have a separate display PHP. Well I'm only doing one API right now, I'm only doing the weather one for.

85 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.292
Yeah, the, my other one's gonna take seven years, but I have a display one.

86 "izik" (376830720)
00:11:30.292 --> 00:11:34.612
I thought we just had to do it. I thought we just had to do it for the weather.

87 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:38.973
Just the weather? Well I don't know. I was not I think it's both, it's both.

88 "izik" (376830720)
00:11:38.973 --> 00:11:42.932
Really? Yeah, it's both. From each from each.

89 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:45.570
Each API. Yeah.

90 "izik" (376830720)
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:55.332
Take whatever you did from lab to and make a button that allows you to fetch a JSON object from each API and put it into the JSON object into a mysql database.

91 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:11:55.332 --> 00:11:57.092
Then use.

92 "izik" (376830720)
00:11:57.092 --> 00:12:08.930
Yeah, dude, this, it's so bad. Like I'm I'm barely into it. I just got my mysql done.

93 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:18.870
And like some page we should talk again. Well, I now have to do the 2nd page or the 2nd one.

94 "izik" (376830720)
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.007
Yeah.

95 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:24.189
Oh, it's pretty bad. Yeah.

96 "izik" (376830720)
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:28.932
Yeah, this is so time consuming. Yeah.

97 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:12:28.932 --> 00:12:30.110
No, it does take forever.

98 "izik" (376830720)
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.692
That means that.

99 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:37.893
So what do we, when's our next meeting? When do you want to schedule that?

100 "izik" (376830720)
00:12:37.893 --> 00:12:45.691
That works for you guys the following the next few days. Do you want to do it Sunday?

101 "Collins, Joshua" (2991350528)
00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:50.230
Cause that's that's given enough time, what time was that.

102 "izik" (376830720)
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.133
Okay.

103 "Hung, Louis" (2056720128)
00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:56.292
Now I have a chapter at twelve to 02:30.

104 "izik" (376830720)
00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:58.049
