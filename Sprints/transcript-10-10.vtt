WEBVTT

1 "izik" (506109184)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.004
Yeah, also can you both approve my merge request? I, I created a.

2 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:11.045
Very basic framework for the statistics page.

3 "izik" (506109184)
00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:17.779
I'm gonna add a new item in progress. I'm gonna say Navar.

4 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.884
Oh. I'm still doing it. You made a new nav bar basically?

5 "izik" (506109184)
00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:26.424
Yeah, I showed you in class. Okay, ok. Yeah, once.

6 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:32.486
We once you push that, we can move it over to the other web, other, pages.

7 "izik" (506109184)
00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:35.843
Yeah, I was gonna show you a.

8 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:00:35.843 --> 00:00:37.248
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead finish sharing my.

9 "izik" (506109184)
00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:55.602
Screen for it, so I'm gonna make a new branch for it because right now what I have, when I put it into the homepage, it like distorts everything. Actually, I'll just show you. Let me just improve your request. What did you do? You did.

10 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:58.084
Oh yeah, let me share my screen with you real quick.

11 "izik" (506109184)
00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:03.862
Yep, then I'll get mine going to.

12 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:15.900
Oh wait, that's the, that's not the one, I don't know why it's.

13 "izik" (506109184)
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:26.621
Okay, so it's broken. Okay, that's really, really annoying. There's a lot of things broken with this.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:42.843
Oh, that's not it. It has to be this one then. No, that's not it either. Damn it waiting. Yeah, here we go. Can you see my webpage or, my BS code?

15 "izik" (506109184)
00:01:42.843 --> 00:01:46.462
Yeah, so that if you click home it goes to home, if it clicks the.

16 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:01:46.462 --> 00:01:56.790
Statistics that stays where it's at. But right now I had it do season wide statistics and then you can be like legal rank for points and then right now I have like player based stats and.

17 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:12.266
Basically off of that, you can, we can sort the basically when we have the data, we can do a fetch and then select all by whatever this column is, and then it shows the players based off of that, that statistic.

18 "izik" (506109184)
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.306
Perfect. I like.

19 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:46.532
Yeah, that way we're just, we have the same data every time the only other fee, the only other way I would see it working out is if we say like enter a player or enter a team, but then we have to do a bunch of checks to make sure that what they enter is valid and what the So this way is just a lot simpler I think with how we're gonna, we need to set up the, the table, but overall I think it's a good start.

20 "izik" (506109184)
00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.665
Yeah. No, I, I agree. I think it was.

21 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:02:49.665 --> 00:03:00.328
Yeah, yeah, so how are you guys doing at least like time wise? Are you guys busy this week or are you guys a little bit more free?

22 "izik" (506109184)
00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:04.686
I'm really free. I'm gonna be working on it.

23 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:05.412
Okay.

24 "izik" (506109184)
00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:11.905
A lot tomorrow. I have to finish my mitre homework and then I'm and I'm watching the meds game, that's really it. Okay.

25 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:37.254
Yeah, yeah, all I have to say for you is just, you know, try try to get that nav bar finished up, resolve any bugs if you can. And then once you're done with that, let us know and we can start throwing it onto the other pages and we can get this cleaned up. And then I guess let me let me show you what that looks like. Yeah, I have the, the login page, is that done?

26 "izik" (506109184)
00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:41.385
Is that what like I'll show you. Okay, yeah.

27 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:46.471
Oh, let me stop sharing. Yeah.

28 "izik" (506109184)
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:47.587
Yeah, you can see.

29 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:03:47.587 --> 00:03:48.851
My screen here? Yes.

30 "izik" (506109184)
00:03:48.851 --> 00:04:11.849
So this is the homepage, right? And I try to put this on there, but you can, as you can see, it moved everything around and I'm trying to work with it and how that works. This is really annoying. I've, I've tried to move padding around. I've tried to move the margin around like I I've been using inspect element and then just clicking on.

31 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.486
Why?

32 "izik" (506109184)
00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:19.465
This move? Is it, is it up? If it's what?

33 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:22.053
This is a div called buffer.

34 "izik" (506109184)
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.964
That could be it.

35 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:38.848
Okay so my guess is whatever it is, is it might basically just be based off the, well, I think it might be a sizing issue.

36 "izik" (506109184)
00:04:38.848 --> 00:04:47.368
Yeah, I think I just found it as well. If I can change, I can't change this on the spot, I can't.

37 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:04:47.368 --> 00:04:58.885
Yeah, let me open a licenser real quick. That's weird, it doesn't cause that issue on mine. I know that something.

38 "izik" (506109184)
00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:11.805
Oh, I got them. So now why isn't this there? Because I just got this to move in with it, but then.

39 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:41.639
Yeah, that's weird because the way that that works is the three columns are in a div called like content. And then you have left column middle of column and right column, and the way that that's set up is that content is a hundred percent the width, and then flex box and it displays everything in a flex, where you have I'm gonna make it up like 20 % for left and right and then 80 % for the middle, so I don't know why it's deciding to move.

40 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.226
That sounds for you.

41 "izik" (506109184)
00:05:44.226 --> 00:05:48.986
Oh. Oh, ok, I just, I just did it.

42 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:51.159
Ah.

43 "izik" (506109184)
00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:56.560
Okay, I gotta figure out how I did it. I just started unclicking buttons.

44 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.000
Well, yeah, just copy all of that and move it into the code.

45 "izik" (506109184)
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.238
What's wrap?

46 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:22.669
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, basically if it's not, if there's not enough space, it'll move whatever's on the right side down and get rid of flex wrap, think that or we'll just alter the flex wrap setting.

47 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.023
Like commented, I got rid of auto as well on.

48 "izik" (506109184)
00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:36.762
Somewhere, yeah. I got rid of it here. It could be overflowed too. I'm gonna try both.

49 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:42.386
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50 "izik" (506109184)
00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:49.681
Okay, well what the fuck? Shit is out.

51 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:58.207
Okay, try overflow.

52 "izik" (506109184)
00:06:58.207 --> 00:07:09.077
Okay, ok. That worked and then it didn't work. Okay.

53 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:07:09.077 --> 00:07:16.372
I don't mean to interrupt. Have you guys found any free MBA apis?

54 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:21.275
On a free API. You were in class so I, I wasn't able to tell you.

55 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:24.473
It's called data hub.

56 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:07:24.473 --> 00:07:24.991
So.

57 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:28.092
If you get the if you sign up to get the, the rookie memb.

58 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:07:28.092 --> 00:07:36.997
It's free, so you the you're limited to 30 calls per minute and 1000 calls per month.

59 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:07:36.997 --> 00:07:48.789
Oh, interesting. Ok. It's, that that sounds cool. I also sent two in the team one thing I understand it was late I sent it now, but I think those should be free from what I looked up, but.

60 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.948
Yeah, I. I just didn't know how to like work it.

61 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:07:52.948 --> 00:08:10.597
It looked weird, so I, let me post this one. That's also a good one, API MBA le let me look at this one. Yeah, I I don't know how to the rapid I aPI.com ones are weird or maybe is it.

62 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:08:10.597 --> 00:08:14.710
The rap or the rapid API API ones?

63 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:20.829
HTTP.

64 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:25.152
Are you saying, are you saying like fetching the rapid APL ones are hard?

65 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:08:25.152 --> 00:08:41.560
Oh wait. Oh wait, NO never mind, oh, I I see it. I have to do it, do it as a oh fetch.

66 "izik" (506109184)
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.670
I don't know how I got this to work.

67 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:52.156
Okay, give me a 2nd. Let me pull back up Webex.

68 "izik" (506109184)
00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:55.350
I don't know how I did it before.

69 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.455
Don't worry, just continue playing with it tonight and tomorrow.

70 "izik" (506109184)
00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:02.208
Yeah, I was gonna show you the other one.

71 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.893
Yeah.

72 "izik" (506109184)
00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:24.566
Don't. The other problems I was having is Yeah I have to fix this. I cannot get into login. I forgot functionality on that. So what I'm gonna do instead is just have a separate login button and then a profile button what that and that will replace it.

73 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:26.208
Yeah, yeah.

74 "izik" (506109184)
00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:28.968
So I just have profile and then setting logout. Yeah.

75 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:35.053
Do that, can you figure out a way to start a session?

76 "izik" (506109184)
00:09:35.053 --> 00:09:37.087
Or what?

77 "8455****02" (4076966400)
00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:44.624
That's a screenshot of how to use the API, you can like do the target as JavaScript and I.

78 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:09:44.624 --> 00:10:11.133
Saw that, it's, basically when we log in we have to start what's called either, you either have to enable or basically we when you log in basically you do the Am I a valid user or not? If you're a valid user, you then initiate something called, I think it's either cookies or a session. And basically what that does is it allows the web page to basically remember who you are as you navigate to different pages.

79 "izik" (506109184)
00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:21.665
Oh, ok, I see you. Yeah, yeah, I don't know how to do that to be honest with you. I can look it up. I can.

80 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:28.349
I don't think it's bad. I think both of them have different purposes. I think W three schools has it.

81 "izik" (506109184)
00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:29.887
Gotcha.

82 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:10:29.887 --> 00:10:46.319
I think you basically just say, like, session start or whatever, in a file and then like if valid session start, and then like if they log out, you say like.

83 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:10:46.319 --> 00:10:53.598
Yeah, if they log out you cancel the session.

84 "izik" (506109184)
00:10:53.598 --> 00:11:09.799
Yeah, Yeah.

85 "izik" (506109184)
00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:43.129
Yeah, where was this? Is this like, oh, it's flex wrap right here and that's in thumbnails, this, let's get rid of that.

86 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:54.657
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think it's called session storage.

87 "izik" (506109184)
00:11:54.657 --> 00:12:12.959
Set some storage. Okay.

88 "izik" (506109184)
00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:28.919
Where's thumbnails? Is that being used anywhere? Thumbnails? Yeah. Oh, here.

89 "izik" (506109184)
00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:33.111
Oh, it's just the images.

90 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:36.148
Yeah, I think this is I think this.

91 "izik" (506109184)
00:12:36.148 --> 00:12:53.949
Because they have the text wrap and somehow I did I tried something and it just worked when you saw me do it. Yeah. There you go.

92 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:59.332
So where do you turn off? Oh yeah, that's really annoying.

93 "izik" (506109184)
00:12:59.332 --> 00:13:21.733
Okay wait. But I tried it, it was text wrapped I tried this and then I got rid of this. Now if I refresh it, it doesn't work, it, I don't know how to explain it. Like I'll I'll go back to.

94 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:26.152
So it works on the web page, but not in refresh.

95 "izik" (506109184)
00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:45.930
I will inspect, go here, turn off flex wrap, and it just works.

96 "izik" (506109184)
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:51.860
Correct. This doesn't make any sense.

97 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:13:51.860 --> 00:14:05.988
I, I think I know what's up. I think whatever the width of whatever we're importing the bar or the hot nav bar, for some reason it's slightly shorter than the rest of the body. So as a.

98 "izik" (506109184)
00:14:05.988 --> 00:14:09.408
Results. No, I know, I know this.

99 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:11.811
Yeah.

100 "izik" (506109184)
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:17.769
But then how do I get the width? Do I just change the width of the.

101 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:20.876
Now barry think.

102 "izik" (506109184)
00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:23.708
To being like a hundred percent or something.

103 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:29.693
Yeah, and then that dropdown just has to get moved over a little bit, I guess.

104 "izik" (506109184)
00:14:29.693 --> 00:14:41.252
Width is already a hundred percent. Fuck, what? What is tab?

105 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:14:41.252 --> 00:14:50.479
I don't know the tabs are the buttons that you click, in the nav bar.

106 "izik" (506109184)
00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:52.328
Yeah.

107 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:14:52.328 --> 00:15:06.285
Yeah, but, yeah, so basically you just, yeah, just play around with it, try to fix that and try to figure out how to do a session, and then I think that's all you need to work on this week cause that's, that's a big task to understand.

108 "izik" (506109184)
00:15:06.285 --> 00:15:08.863
And yeah.

109 "Collins, Joshua" (2017090816)
00:15:08.863 --> 00:15:19.991
