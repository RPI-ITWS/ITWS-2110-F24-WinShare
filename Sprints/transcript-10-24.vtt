00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.153
Reminder Shema's gonna remain muted because he's in a crowded spacing.

2 "izik" (2007079424)
00:00:05.153 --> 00:00:09.436
Can't talk without interference.

3 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:14.780
I forgot, who has the the slides real quick? I just wanted to double check them.

4 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.457
I think it's in the DC I guess. Yeah.

5 "izik" (2007079424)
00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:25.178
We basically did our presentation, which is pretty funny.

6 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:32.103
Yeah, I also just made a new merge request. Also, thank you Isaac for getting that conflict.

7 "izik" (2007079424)
00:00:32.103 --> 00:00:34.820
Resolved. Yeah, yeah. No, it was super quick.

8 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:49.604
Yeah, NO, it was funny because it's like, I don't know why it came up because there's like, like fetch from the, the, from the main branch, but it just never like changed the nav button.

9 "izik" (2007079424)
00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:57.122
Yeah, that was weird. I I've never seen that before. Like I'm proposing changes for this. Why are you telling me to resolve conflict.

10 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:00:57.122 --> 00:01:05.521
You know, it was so weird, so, if you have that issue, I recommend just opening opening a new branch moving all the stuff over.

11 "izik" (2007079424)
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.398
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:11.699
Yeah, because that's why I didn't fix that issue at least.

13 "izik" (2007079424)
00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:20.300
Yeah, I'm gonna run into that same issue again because I have more updates. I'm trying to fix the page.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.599
Okay, say that again?

15 "izik" (2007079424)
00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:31.074
So when you open the dropdown, you just gotten really?

16 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:34.739
Oh yeah, you got really laggy for a 2nd.

17 "izik" (2007079424)
00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:46.379
Yeah, our Wi-Fi has been really bad. But yeah, when you open the stats page and you open the dropdown, it like you can move the page left to right, which is not great.

18 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.041
Oh, you can. I'm just trying to get that worked.

19 "izik" (2007079424)
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:57.682
Yeah, it's weird I don't know it doesn't do that on any other site and I try to see if, if maybe there's like an extra div somewhere because that's that was the problem before.

20 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:18.380
But yeah, that's weird a problem right now. Oh yeah, let me share my screen real quick Cause this actually let me go live so I can just show you like what I have so far cause I don't know the other two have seen at least what it is so far. 1 s.

21 "izik" (2007079424)
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.457
Yeah, I think I also I need to, change all the nav bars to set the index.PHP.

22 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:41.100
Yeah, so this is basically somewhat of what I see. So you have to search for statistic and you have search for a player. The idea is like this one's just a simple dropdown that we can see and search for a player, if you do like Lebron, you get like a long dropdown.

23 "izik" (2007079424)
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.092
Oh.

24 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:54.221
Well, but if you click on the name, you can search it, but you can't search it's it's ****** up the icon when initially it's supposed to be like this, but I'll figure.

25 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:56.934
Isn't the idea is like if I type in like.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:02:56.934 --> 00:03:18.420
Lebron all lowercase as well, and at least for the stat page with that dropdown, I think if we limit the stat page it is the top 200 most popular players just to keep that dropdown like short, I think we should be fine.

27 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.619
The dropdown is JR.

28 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:33.897
That's great? Yes. So the idea is that I can use the JS to at least filter what goes into the PHP request and then I could also filter the input through PHP as well.

29 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:46.100
But do we need to put on the PHP Cause our, isn't our idea about like grabbing the data into a JSON file in our like local? Yeah, I guessing it is.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:54.601
Yeah, I guess like a fetch it just I don't need to grab it from the table.

31 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:03:54.601 --> 00:04:01.614
Yeah, cause we don't really need like up to date data. Like we don't need an API call every time someone visits a website.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:08.939
Yeah, you're right. I'll I'll get something cooked up for that then.

33 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:36.400
And did you guys check the new API, like, what's it called against What's a lot of looking yet, but I was intending on doing that. Yeah, that one gives you like the exact output and the exact call that you need to get the API. So, and on the other hand, if you want to get like a game ID on the Hook data hub, you need a team, you need a game ID.

34 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.979
Okay, yeah, so then you were planning on to use that.

35 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:48.559
That for predictions and you can just call the hoop data hub for the stats for like players. Okay.

36 "izik" (2007079424)
00:04:48.559 --> 00:05:03.596
If you, if you hit the, oh, you stopped sharing your screen, but if you if you if you check the stats page and just click the login dropdown, you'll see what I'm talking about. It's, it's super small, but like it's really annoying.

37 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:10.553
What do you like I can't click anything, but it Oh, it's it's like a little bit off the screen.

38 "izik" (2007079424)
00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:17.516
Yeah, it's off the screen and you can, you can move like horizontally. It's weird.

39 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:19.995
For prediction space, I'll fix that.

40 "izik" (2007079424)
00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:38.073
In the stops page and I just don't know how to fix it because it's the exact same nav bar. I I don't know what's wrong with it. Oh, you mean the like the scroll button? Yeah, there's a scroll at the bottom of the screen and you can just scroll.

41 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:05:38.073 --> 00:05:45.637
Right. You might need to just see if you can shift that dropdown like over and then down slightly.

42 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:46.639
It's.

43 "izik" (2007079424)
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:53.575
Problem because some different problems with the prediction part.

44 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:05:53.575 --> 00:05:59.437
Wait what? It's probably because like the dev for the predictions, I think.

45 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:05.097
No wait, wait. The prediction page is also weird.

46 "izik" (2007079424)
00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:07.276
Oh yeah.

47 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:06:07.276 --> 00:06:17.220
It goes, oh yeah, the, the predictions, it goes behind predictions Yeah you can just change a Z index.

48 "izik" (2007079424)
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:26.338
Yeah, yeah, that's actly what I did. And then I got rid of in mainframe the position fixed or.

49 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:06:26.338 --> 00:06:38.657
I got rid of that issue. Yeah also my one question for the prediction pages, how are we gonna have the user input the data?

50 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:59.629
Oh, yeah, we talked about this last time. So we wanted to do so that like what if you click into the game, you're brought to another website that's where it shows the games statistics and how you want to bed it. So that thing, yeah, that thing will be like unique for each one of the games and like the content.

51 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:05.959
Will have like a framework and everything in set will be generated by JS according to the things that you select.

52 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.618
Okay, sounds good.

53 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:07:07.618 --> 00:07:10.655
Yeah, but like NO one's working on that right now.

54 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:13.635
Yeah, we'll we'll we'll get there. That's like gonna be the last big piece.

55 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:25.256
I guess. Yeah, just like the last JS piece of fetching the data for individual team or I can just like basically copy and paste what I'm going to do for the profiles for each player. That's what I'm I'm currently working on.

56 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:07:25.256 --> 00:07:47.036
Okay, yeah, that that'll work, yeah, I think that will do it. That'll be a good way to finish it up because once I mean once we get statistics and then this kind of like link everything up, also do you think the statistics page needs to be a HTML or a PHP file?

57 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:56.198
The Honestly, if it doesn't fetch anything from MySQL, it doesn't have to be appeared.

58 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:07:56.198 --> 00:08:03.402
Okay, so I'll keep I'll keep it HTML then just for the sake of.

59 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:08:03.402 --> 00:08:15.430
But if, because she would did like the header.PHP for the nav boards and if we want to do the if we want to use headers.php, then we have to use a PhP I think.

60 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.970
Okay.

61 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.446
Yeah, but yeah I'll just confirm with.

62 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:08:22.446 --> 00:08:29.652
Isaac which one's easier for him because if that fixes the issue by converting it to PHP, that's fine.

63 "izik" (2007079424)
00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:32.271
Which one?

64 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:41.483
The stat the stat page if using that header that Shemu had. I didn't I didn't even look at that.

65 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:08:41.483 --> 00:08:51.590
Okay. He basically just the nav bars into a file and then just input that file in every PHP file so that you don't have, we don't have to do repetitive snaff bar.

66 "izik" (2007079424)
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.770
I mean, yeah, that's that's smart, that's really small.

67 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.209
Okay.

68 "izik" (2007079424)
00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:00.871
I mean, if you can do that, that'd be great.

69 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:04.914
I think you had a seven.

70 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:09:04.914 --> 00:09:28.112
Yeah, and also as a fair warning, Prenee might not be here on Friday. He texted me, he texted me I don't know why he texted me specifically, but he just said like if the professor didn't see his text, he wanted to let us know that he might not be there cause he hasn't like some other like presentation or thing, something.

71 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:09:28.112 --> 00:09:30.930
Well, it's.

72 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.492
Like it's fine. We we got all four of us we're the dream team.

73 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:46.090
Yeah, exactly. We'll make it, we'll we'll make it work. It's just gonna work without.

74 "izik" (2007079424)
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:51.253
What has he done? Like the.

75 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:09:52.528 --> 00:09:55.371
The.

76 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:58.572
Commit yeah and that one will be commit.

77 "izik" (2007079424)
00:09:58.572 --> 00:10:10.191
Great. And the logo. Alright. And the logo. So that's someone can talk about his logo.

78 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:18.326
Yeah, we'll we'll show like we Yeah we'll show the we'll highlight that when we when we're on the title screen.

79 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:33.687
I have another logo updated to GitHub though if you guys want to check it out, I just ******* delly generated It should be in the assets folder and photos.

80 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:10:33.687 --> 00:10:43.945
Yeah, I'm gonna add to the JavaScript cause I use that one.

81 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:10:43.945 --> 00:10:50.923
I don't know. Do we have to fix out the PowerPoint for presentation?

82 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:52.816
Like you say again.

83 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:59.085
Do you had to fix the PowerPoint, the Google Docs for the presentation? I think that's kind of like rushed.

84 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:06.707
Yeah, it's definitely yeah we can work on it today and tomorrow, if we work on our own times and just clean it up I think we'll be good.

85 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:07.984
Yeah.

86 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:11:07.984 --> 00:11:18.865
Okay, because I think for the most part our information is our, all of our information's there. It's just whether or not we want to fill that out a little bit more and styles.

87 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:22.542
A little bit. I mean make it better always doesn't hurt.

88 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:40.941
Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, I'll I'll definitely work on that in the future. I have, what was it? Yeah, I have my hacking class tomorrow. We're, we're getting ready for our big hackathon this weekend.

89 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:44.107
It's this weekend I saw it's at the beginning of November now.

90 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:57.321
I don't know there's another one at the beginning of November or actually NO, sorry. There's a different one the one that is for like NCL individual hackathon. I think the November ones have.

91 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:11:57.321 --> 00:12:03.402
Back RPI. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Slightly different. Okay.

92 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:12:03.402 --> 00:12:32.178
Yeah, but overall, I I think we are in relatively good shape because then I think if we think about this right, the only thing we really have to do once the stat page is done, well, we just have to do a little bit more JS on the stat page, which I'll take care of. Prediction page we just need to get that 2nd page up and running once you click on like a game and then have the, the PHP working in the background to add like add or remove points if you're right or wrong.

93 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:12:32.178 --> 00:12:46.541
Oh yeah for that, do we want to do it like live or do we want to do it like just You can predict on the past games.

94 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:52.045
I'm guess we could predict on past games to show like proof of concept.

95 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:12:52.045 --> 00:13:07.705
Yeah, cause like if you want to do it, like, e.g., today's the 23rd. If you want to do like predictions on a game that's on the 25th, then how, like storing the prediction data is another problem that I'm considering.

96 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:36.787
Yeah, cause we have to constantly keep that data updated on the predictions page so you click a game to get a live data. And then on top of that, you have to do like overall statistics, and then we have to have some kind of measurement that goes in basically says like, when they log in, check their predictions and update their points. It's a lot more that goes in rather than like, make your prediction on a past game if correct points go up, if wrong.

97 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:40.417
Points go down. Yeah, we can just do that.

98 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:53.879
Yeah, that that way we get the proof of concept down and we can still kind of like make it look good. Yeah, and then we should be good after that. I mean it's basically just.

99 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:13:53.879 --> 00:14:09.966
Get the homepage looking a little nice nicer. I haven't seen it cause I, also can somebody send me the link and discord to the, the VM Cause I couldn't like the homepage because I couldn't get that working the other.

100 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:14.119
Today just download the SQL.

101 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.264
What do you mean download the.

102 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:14:16.264 --> 00:14:25.543
So the user SQL into the chat and you can download our exam and run it locally.

103 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:14:25.543 --> 00:14:35.341
Oh **** I haven't figured out how to run XMPS yet. I've just been kind of busy, but I'll figure.

104 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:41.965
Yeah, we're all busy this week. I just finished three tests for the past two days.

105 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:48.048
But should it just need the URL/index.phb?

106 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:14:48.048 --> 00:14:58.827
I think it should be like/whatever the folder is called. RTWS 2011 F 24 wind share.

107 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:14:58.827 --> 00:15:17.423
Yeah, I forgot it was through the ITWS, and so it's ITWS-2110-F 20 four-or whatever the don't worry, I'll get it. Is there anything else we need for this meeting?

108 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:15:17.423 --> 00:15:21.300
I don't think so.

109 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:28.619
I think we've been I think we are really ahead like on pace at least.

110 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:57.643
Because, with October almost being done, we'll definitely get I'll we'll try I'll try to get the stat page done this week and next week. If not, i'll push that off to sprint three and get it done right at the beginning. Depends on how tests play out, but at least from my part I I'm good there. I know Zeek, you're, you're pretty much wrapped up as aside from fixing a few small bugs.

111 "izik" (2007079424)
00:15:57.643 --> 00:16:00.982
Another prediction pages on relatively.

112 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:16:00.982 --> 00:16:14.224
Finished in terms of how it's gonna look right, look initially, and then we'll finish that back end functionality in the next sprint, and then we'll clean up the homepage and then we should be good.

113 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:19.226
Maybe add one or two like.

114 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:36.082
On pages like the about me page and then like the setting page should just be like coming soon, but if you're near you or something. Cause I don't think we have need any, I don't think we have need a functional settings page.

115 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:16:36.082 --> 00:16:39.408
We can just do like darken light mode.

116 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:40.689
One or something like that. He's.

117 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:16:40.689 --> 00:16:57.320
Yeah, Sounds good. So I hope you guys have a great evening. I'll see you guys on Friday. I don't know that we're gonna go in for the presentations, but I think we're.

118 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.822
Gonna be 1st. Yeah, same here.

119 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:16:59.822 --> 00:17:01.192
Well.

120 "izik" (2007079424)
00:17:01.192 --> 00:17:06.467
They said it was randomly generated. Oh, right. Oh, right. He said it's randomly.

121 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:21.945
But it's randomly generated but also did everybody prove my emerge request for chance?

122 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:17:21.945 --> 00:17:23.677
I can do that. Yeah, I'll do that.

123 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:33.720
You know yeah they can already did one. So that way we can update the statistics page but overall I think we're in a good spot.

124 "izik" (2007079424)
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.164
Is there anything else I should do or if anyone needs help? Because I'm I'm pretty free this week, I'm pretty free.

125 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:17:40.164 --> 00:17:42.464
Next week as well.

126 "izik" (2007079424)
00:17:42.464 --> 00:17:43.702
Anyone like anyone's help on.

127 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:17:43.702 --> 00:18:02.143
Or I can maybe check the projects page. So we've like last meeting with me and we did like a lot of to DOS on a project page and like if you're just free just choose one and then just try to do it because we had like specific descriptions written on it.

128 "izik" (2007079424)
00:18:02.143 --> 00:18:06.002
Okay. All right. I can.

129 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:24.169
Sounds good. Oh yeah, just main page data insert separate function, add prediction page. Stop stopped logged in user from visiting login page, add new page to view data for a team, add a new page to view data for a player.

130 "izik" (2007079424)
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:29.771
Yeah, I'll I'll brainstorm things. I was gonna do like add new pages to view teams or players.

131 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:18:29.771 --> 00:18:34.808
But yeah do it for the teams right now because we have the stat page where you can look it up for apply.

132 "izik" (2007079424)
00:18:34.808 --> 00:18:37.035
Yeah. At least.

133 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:18:37.035 --> 00:18:41.282
As of right now for the top 200 most popular players.

134 "izik" (2007079424)
00:18:41.282 --> 00:18:48.395
Yeah, I'm gonna try to base it off of like what ESPN or I know the NHL does it too. I'm gonna try to base off of that and see what.

135 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:18:48.395 --> 00:19:04.599
What I can do. Because it's just a stat page, right? Yeah and also I was I meant to continue on my thought yesterday I said it earlier. I think we're gonna go 1st because on Friday the NCL individual hackathon starts at one, which is halfway through our.

136 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:06.644
E class. Oh, so do you want to go.

137 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:19:06.644 --> 00:19:22.582
Go 1st. Well, with the fact that I'm participating in that starting at one and the fact that Professor Callihan is my professor for the class that's mandatory for me to participate in a hackathon, he's gonna probably make us go 1st.

138 "izik" (2007079424)
00:19:22.582 --> 00:19:25.938
Oh, yeah. That's fine then we'll get out of the way.

139 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:19:25.938 --> 00:19:30.681
And then it'll just be like, hey, can, can I go 1st?

140 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:19:30.681 --> 00:19:38.804
Yeah, well, NO, yeah, he's gonna be like, you guys go 1st and then he'll then at 01:00 point to me and say, you go into the corner.

141 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:19:40.338 --> 00:19:44.505
So I'll have to leave you guys at one and go sit in the corner and do my hacking.

142 "Hung, Louis" (3378887680)
00:19:44.505 --> 00:19:47.764
Yeah, NO problem. We can just do it and show.

143 "Collins, Joshua" (1202586368)
00:19:47.764 --> 00:20:07.443
Yeah, I I think but I'm gonna say it again, but I think we're at a really good spot at least in terms of how our pages are looking yeah so with that said, I'd beg you guys a good evening and get some sleep.

144 "izik" (2007079424)
00:20:07.443 --> 00:20:08.664
Yep.
