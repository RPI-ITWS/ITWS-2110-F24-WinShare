1 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.553
I, I I didn't realize that I wasn't recording ok we're recording now, so we're, that works. So, we were both talking about the general layout of the main page. We're thinking about doing, like, can you see the whiteboard?

2 "izik" (1801721600)
00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:22.665
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Yeah, so we have.

3 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.568
Two sides. This is just the the left side is the general framework.

4 "izik" (1801721600)
00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.905
Work that we're working on before.

5 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:33.090
And then the right side is what we think about the homepage. So.

6 "izik" (1801721600)
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.387
Okay, that's fine.

7 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:00:36.387 --> 00:00:45.196
So we're thinking about basically for the homepage you have like the logos stats, sports, and then a dropdown as like a navigation bar.

8 "izik" (1801721600)
00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:48.004
You can get like a profile page.

9 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.249
See if you're logged in.

10 "izik" (1801721600)
00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:56.973
Do you think it's too much on the screen? Like, especially this oh wait, can you still.

11 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:04.809
Oh, it's gonna be way smaller when we're making at the actual product. It won't be like this big because it's kind of hard to draw.

12 "izik" (1801721600)
00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.887
Yeah. No I I know I know. So this is the dropdown. Oh, this is the dropdown that is ok, ok, I see I see.

13 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:22.403
Yeah, so like the dropdown will obviously be a lot smaller. Yeah. And then the top ten maybe it will take up like half the page or something but and then this is our header up here.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:36.218
What is this? Quote, a quote, like we provide statistics, you provide predictions or something like that or we can revise that later.

15 "izik" (1801721600)
00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:39.932
Oh, this is just the, this is just the oh, ok, I see. Yeah.

16 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:01:39.932 --> 00:02:04.950
So at the bottom I think if the middle part's like 50 are yeah 5020 500 above. Yeah, yeah. Actually, probably like a 6020. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, It's Because here's the thing. We below this dropdown we could have like sponsors if we want anything there.

17 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:20.700
Just to make it more symmetrical yeah yeah yeah behind navigating these the sponsors if we want to.

18 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:37.740
And, le left side you have the top ten players currently playing, and in the middle you have like the logo quotes, three or four super.

19 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:53.477
Yeah, three or four game sorry. Yeah, three or three or four like super popular games currently right now, and then at the bottom it would be like it would be like create account today.

20 "izik" (1801721600)
00:02:53.477 --> 00:03:07.549
Okay. Yeah. Do you want to do popular games or do you want to do like popular stats or like popular?

21 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.069
That's where we don't have to do that right away. That's yeah.

22 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:16.669
Something popular goes there. Okay.

23 "izik" (1801721600)
00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:25.188
Maybe like popular things that people are betting on. And that doesn't have to be functional, That'll just be like static, but, yeah.

24 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:32.714
So I, I I think this is a good starting point at least in terms of like the, the load, like the load out of our website.

25 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:37.052
Yeah, it's very rough right now, so it's like obviously something to change.

26 "izik" (1801721600)
00:03:37.052 --> 00:03:45.951
Yeah we'll probably like change it as we start. Did you, did we go over like who's doing what? Was everyone in here in here or?

27 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:47.831
Was just me and Josh and you.

28 "izik" (1801721600)
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:52.151
Two people ****.

29 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:58.492
Yeah. Lewis, I think his name is.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.996
And then the other guy, he, he is Renee.

31 "izik" (1801721600)
00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:06.169
Yeah.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:18.470
Yeah, he, he doesn't like to pay attention to discord that much. So I'm not knocking him but yeah so we we need to probably tomorrow we should probably talk to him about.

33 "izik" (1801721600)
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.969
Yeah. Do we have anything due for tomorrow? No, it's.

34 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:27.516
I'm pretty sure that's gonna be APIs.

35 "izik" (1801721600)
00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:30.370
Sweet like team or individual?

36 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:46.631
Individual but we could still talk to each other about how to like work APIs because I've never used them before. Yeah. Yeah, but overall this is a good start. We should probably meet tomorrow night as well.

37 "izik" (1801721600)
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.150
I don't know, I can't do it tomorrow night.

38 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.657
I do tomorrow night? No.

39 "izik" (1801721600)
00:04:50.657 --> 00:05:03.391
No, and I I in class of four. Okay. Yeah, I mean I can do like five.

40 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:04.931
You can do five?

41 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:12.878
Yeah I'm not I have class until six tomorrow. Oh, ok. So I would be, it would be at night for me like sometime.

42 "izik" (1801721600)
00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:16.127
Okay, what about like seven? Yeah, I can.

43 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:05:16.127 --> 00:05:29.788
Okay I mean if it's only gonna be like what three of us? Well, yeah. So basically what that is, is I'll start working a little bit on the HTML tomorrow, just like a very quick outline. Oh, yeah.

44 "izik" (1801721600)
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.551
Wow.

45 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:45.949
Well, I already made a push basically cleaning up the file system that we currently have. Like I moved all the proposals into a file. The constitution stuff's in its own file and now it's basically just a read me in the main, in the main webpage.

46 "izik" (1801721600)
00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.189
Yeah yeah ok yeah.

47 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.928
But I think we're all good.

48 "izik" (1801721600)
00:05:51.928 --> 00:05:55.451
Is there like an idea of what you guys wanna do?

49 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:05:55.451 --> 00:06:03.006
Do you know how to do you know how to set up the SQL stuff with the current I'm really bad with that.

50 "izik" (1801721600)
00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:11.578
That was the one thing I I really screwed up on. I'm good with the CSS part. That's, I'm really good at that. And like CSS was just like animations. I think I think.

51 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:06:11.578 --> 00:06:29.200
We've yeah, we could definitely have you do a lot of the JavaScript and CSS in terms of like getting things to flow correctly. Yeah. I could definitely hand Yeah, I we just need to figure out the, how to set up like the tables.

52 "izik" (1801721600)
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.143
Yeah, the tables is really annoying. I hated that so much.

53 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.946
I could probably get started on that like very roughly.

54 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:52.764
Yeah, if, and if anybody would get access to the tables, it would be you pan. Yeah cause you have, you're you're the one who owns the web page, right? Or the VM?

55 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:06:52.764 --> 00:06:55.419
Yeah.

56 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:05.421
Yes, I think you would have to set that up, but we can definitely talk to the, we, we will all talk, we should talk to Callihant tomorrow as a group to figure out how we do that.

57 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:12.060
Yeah, I could also add you guys to the VM if you guys want.

58 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.103
Oh yeah, we Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.

59 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:17.777
Yes I could do that tomorrow in class.

60 "izik" (1801721600)
00:07:17.777 --> 00:07:22.479
Did you like, how did you set up the VM to the GitHub?

61 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:28.017
I literally just pushed GitHub.

62 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:40.879
If you guys want, I could show you how to, like to end off the meeting, I could show you guys how to put your, your, like your GitHub on your personal VM. I was just asking me about that, right?

63 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:56.824
Yeah, because I I saw the steps, but I was like, how does that do that? Like how does it work exactly? Is it, is it basically the steps that we did an intro? Or NO, but is it the steps that call hands told you?

64 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:07:56.824 --> 00:08:06.956
Yeah, I could do like a screen share and if you guys want to follow along cause I gotta do it from my own VM. Yeah yeah NO worries. And you're recording this, right? We could like just show.

65 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:08:06.956 --> 00:08:17.024
It says record, so I think we're good. I need to figure out how to collect that file. I think at least right now it shouldn't be an issue.

66 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:21.557
That could just happen later, we're.

67 "izik" (1801721600)
00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:33.100
Who was singing? I don't know if you guys hear that, I doubt you guys do, but No I didn't hear it today. Okay. It's pretty funny.

68 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:48.705
Yeah, I didn't hear any hear singing from. Yeah, give me 1 s.

69 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:08:50.700 --> 00:09:06.947
So I, I think this is a good part. If you guys have like an extra 15 20 min or you're free tomorrow, oh yeah, I'll handle the HTML tomorrow and then for the in terms of the weekend we can work on our own, at our own paces.

70 "izik" (1801721600)
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:15.919
Yeah, after we assign work, right? Yeah. Give a scrum master? Do we need that?

71 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:21.298
No, NO. Technically I think our professor is the scrum master.

72 "izik" (1801721600)
00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:29.718
Oh, ok. Yeah. Oh yeah yeah yeah and then we're all developers, ok. Yes.

73 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:09:29.718 --> 00:09:34.684
Yeah, so I think we're all, we're all good.

74 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:09:34.684 --> 00:09:35.957
Yeah yeah.

75 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:09:35.957 --> 00:09:39.763
So, we'll, we'll call it.

76 "izik" (1801721600)
00:09:39.763 --> 00:09:45.137
Oh, was he gonna show us how to get the Vmiss up? I think if you.

77 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:49.083
I could share my if you guys want I could share my screen right now and set up with you.

78 "izik" (1801721600)
00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:52.339
If you wanted to do it Josh I mean, I don't know. Yeah, yeah.

79 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:09:52.339 --> 00:09:53.662
If you wouldn't mind showing us right now.

80 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:09:53.662 --> 00:10:08.899
Okay, yeah. All right. Let me share my screen ok could you guys see my screen? Yes. Yes. Okay.

81 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:16.101
Sorry, let me You probably have your own black account.

82 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:20.770
Alright, so you gotta get the command 1st from Callhan?

83 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:33.256
Oh yeah, I threw it in the team one a while ago, but I'll I'll do it again.

84 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:10:33.256 --> 00:10:37.294
Oh, where the hell?

85 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:10:37.294 --> 00:10:46.353
Oh yeah, it's really far up there. Use the search bar for like pseudo.

86 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:10:46.353 --> 00:10:56.912
Oh, right here, ok. So, ok, get this, so you wanna SSH into your VM real quick?

87 "izik" (1801721600)
00:10:56.912 --> 00:11:02.793
You'd have to use that search bar? Right, you went into general, oh.

88 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:11:02.793 --> 00:11:10.199
Yeah, just type in just type in what is it? Pseudo, and dr..

89 "izik" (1801721600)
00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:11.599
Yeah I got it.

90 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:15.699
And you guys gotta start your your VM.

91 "izik" (1801721600)
00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:18.637
Oh, yeah.

92 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:11:18.637 --> 00:11:21.991
And you guys know the connector, right?

93 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.871
Yes I well, what do you mean today.

94 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:27.055
Like your.

95 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:36.403
Save in the link. Yep.

96 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:11:36.403 --> 00:11:44.617
And get the, open up your.

97 "izik" (1801721600)
00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:47.995
It's taken so long to load my VM.

98 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:11:47.995 --> 00:12:05.029
Yeah, I think that's normal. Yep. Okay, so you basically just wait.

99 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:24.839
Sure VN comes up, log in, ok, and then you literally copy and paste the code.

100 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:12:50.626 --> 00:13:08.704
Yeah, and then afterwards you get this key, right? Just copy and copy and paste the whole thing that spits out. You go to, you go to your GitHub repository, settings, deploy keys, and you just add a key.

101 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:16.909
And will that mean, will that automatically update it every time that you turn on the VM or?

102 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:25.823
The key will always be there. This just makes it so you could connect to the, it'll it'll allow you to pull your repository onto the VM.

103 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:13:25.823 --> 00:13:29.352
Okay, and then do you do like a get pull? Yeah.

104 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:13:29.352 --> 00:13:49.679
Just go to/bar/and then you just do pseudo git pull, your GitHub repository pseudo git pull this should be HTTPS.

105 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:13:49.679 --> 00:14:03.857
Oh, and it's not git pull I'm so dumb, it's, it's a git clone.

106 "izik" (1801721600)
00:14:03.857 --> 00:14:07.155
Pseudo get cloned.

107 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:11.534
Yeah, I was pulling nothing.

108 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:14.276
Okay.

109 "Pan, Shimu" (573298688)
00:14:14.276 --> 00:14:21.995
Yep, let's do yes, and that's it. You got the repository.

110 "Collins, Joshua" (3213051136)
00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:25.637
That's good. Okay, thank you so much.
