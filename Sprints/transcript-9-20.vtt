1 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.831
Okay, I'm recording.

2 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:06.026
Are people coming in though?

3 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:10.890
Yeah, more should come in. Let me check.

4 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.747
Yeah real quick.

5 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:18.200
Let's see, we said he.

6 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.870
And Andy? Yeah.

7 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.708
Yeah, Isaac and Prenee are the other two are waiting on.

8 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:36.789
Okay cool.

9 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:56.720
Yeah, let me take this time to pull up the github on a separate tab, did you see my latest pull request?

10 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.089
Okay.

11 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.211
An after, is that it?

12 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:11.989
Yes, I basically added a navigation bar to the top of our main webpage as like an idea of what it should look like.

13 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.730
Ah, ok, interesting.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:29.006
Yeah, it just basically is the home button statistics predictions, and then a triple bar for a dropdown menu where it'd be like login, it would be like account login slash.

15 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:35.008
Sorry, shouldn't login be like on the right hand side on the top?

16 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:40.988
It can't we, we, yeah, we can fit that in if we want to up there.

17 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:01:40.988 --> 00:02:01.409
Well it's it could be later yep it's just I think I'll draw like a general picture of what I think navigation should look like or like at least the web page should look like over the weekend and like maybe we can talk about that later some sometimes. Yeah.

18 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:10.050
Of course, in the in the thing, we do have our sprint MP four recording.

19 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.070
Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, yeah.

20 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.765
Yeah, in that one we did draw like a very quick idea, but we were always free to move that about since we're so early on.

21 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:27.606
Yeah, I can I can work, I can work, I can work on that, but then push it to you like later.

22 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.526
We're. Yep.

23 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:46.668
So it should be fine. Yeah, of course, where are the other people?

24 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:02:46.668 --> 00:02:53.502
Unfortunately, it seems like you, me, and Shebu are the only three that really use discord.

25 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:55.626
Oh, really? Oh.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:02:55.626 --> 00:03:02.666
So the other two teams tend to like go on periods where you can't hear them or won't they won't respond.

27 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:08.909
Oh, I'm like almost always on this code, but I just turned notification off sometimes so.

28 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:18.148
Yeah, I need to get the notifications to start working on this one because I have it on for another class that's working, but this one's pretty silent.

29 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:30.947
Oh, I should turn it on to like only at will like, yeah. I should turn to all. I'll turn it to all.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:03:30.947 --> 00:03:46.587
Yeah. So I think for this one, for this one I was gonna start, well, I, I wanted to add like that dropdown menu just to make it like, at least kind of like add a little bit more functionality to the front page.

31 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:03:46.587 --> 00:04:01.249
So somehow, so if you open, ok, let's search e.g.. If you open the unsplash, the homepage.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.261
Unsplash.

33 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:13.507
Wait, I'll go to a special page. Just want to see e.g., do you do you want to do something like on the top right corner, right next to the profile pick?

34 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:18.404
Yeah, like that except, right under that bar, it would just dropdown.

35 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:21.085
So, and then if you click again again.

36 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:22.625
They would just scroll back up.

37 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:37.397
Okay, but like my question here is do we need that much tabs that like for us that to need a dropdown list? Do we have that many web pages to fit like the whole dropdown list?

38 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:49.727
Probably not, we could probably do like a dropdown for like account, we could probably change that icon to like, a person outline, like account.

39 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:04:49.727 --> 00:05:05.623
Click it drops down it could be like settings, what not. Yeah. Okay, so just as you like click on your own profile pick on unsplash.com, it's just like view profile stats, log out, login, account settings, something like that.

40 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:09.023
Yeah. Okay, sounds.

41 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:05:09.023 --> 00:05:35.602
Yeah, that sounds cool. Sounds sounds cool to me. It's just like four like cause the menus, all we have now, it's just the vetting page, the leaders, the leaderboard page and like the prediction page, so I was like not too sure about how much tabs or how much like HTML files do we actually need to be to full, to fill the entire dropdown list.

42 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:43.903
Yeah, it was only gonna be like two or three more options like maybe like an about us page or like a logout button.

43 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:46.482
Yeah, that makes sense.

44 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:05:46.482 --> 00:05:56.062
Yeah, like buttons that would add, like, niche functionality that don't need to be visible at the, at the very start.

45 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:05:56.062 --> 00:05:58.355
Like that's cool. That's cool for me.

46 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:04.699
Yeah. Because the good news about that is at least we can we can copy and paste that basically every single web.

47 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:16.663
Yeah or we can just like do it for the profile pick 1st and then like once we have the basic code for the profile pick, we can just change the CSS update if we want to fit it onto our navigation bars.

48 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:06:16.663 --> 00:06:18.423
Yeah.

49 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:20.084
Yeah, that sounds like a plan.

50 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:06:20.084 --> 00:06:28.023
Yeah, I just went with the 3 bar right now cause that's like the most standard button I've seen at least for like click for more.

51 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:41.562
Oh yeah. I mean the standard buttons are good, at least they're consistent, and they don't make a big mess on the page, but if you want to be more fancy, I guess we can do the dropdown list.

52 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:56.542
Yes. Yeah, and that's like a simple CSS of like, actually let me push what I currently have as well, I basically just have some borders set up for, like, three parts.

53 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:06:56.542 --> 00:07:00.543
Oh yeah, the hot bars yep.

54 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:02.583
Oh.

55 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:05.423
Yeah, it's a simple setup I can see here.

56 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:11.740
Yeah, it, it will, that, but also, I have like a red border in the middle of the screen.

57 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.621
To make column, right? Column left column?

58 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:40.099
Yeah, basically it's gonna follow like a 20 4020 kind of layout where like on the left side, we can put something as simple as top, top ten on the leaderboard. I mean, we can do it by like point like like points scored. Ah, ok. Number one would be person one and it would cut off if it's too long. Person two, person three, person.

59 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:49.962
For person five, then the right side can be sponsors, and that's when the dropdown menu can like block that part if, we want to.

60 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:07:49.962 --> 00:07:56.699
Or just include the ad on the side and be like, hey, go buy merchants from the store.

61 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:02.499
Yeah, yeah. Like ball is live sponsored by the nbn.

62 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:04.541
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

63 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:23.802
And then in the middle one it was just gonna be like our logo at the top, a quote from us, maybe then like three or four like recent games or like noteworthy games from this season or like some kind of statistics and say want more question mark, join today.

64 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:26.786
At the Interesting.

65 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:08:26.786 --> 00:08:38.924
Want to make a prediction, click here. Like the main page should just be like quick, like a quick, starting point to navigate to others, other parts of the site.

66 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:08:38.924 --> 00:08:39.841
Mm.

67 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:42.663
It doesn't It doesn't have to be crazy.

68 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:08:42.663 --> 00:09:04.319
I was thinking about for the main page, like, cause you know a lot of websites, they don't put anything on the main page. They just put like slogans or like big pub big pictures or things like that on the main page. And you have to like click in for more.

69 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:28.910
In order to go to different sections. Yeah, you know, do you know what I mean? Yes. I think it's not Right like apple, like Apple's website, it's basically just like only their phones on the very front and there's not much information and I kind of want to just do that cause.

70 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.671
Yeah, that makes it seems cool.

71 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:49.077
Or what's the middle? Oh yeah. I want I don't know if we could do this but like there's those animation like animation websites where you like scroll down and the entire thing change. Do you get what I mean?

72 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:51.529
Can you say that again? Like.

73 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:09:51.529 --> 00:10:06.447
Because for some websites, like when you just scroll down, there's gonna be animations according to how much you scroll down. I think there's one team that did it in my intro class last year and I think they got like a really high point on out of doing that, so.

74 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:10:06.447 --> 00:10:15.851
I believe it. That could be very possible like if they, so you said basically if they scroll like a certain speed at a certain speed?

75 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:19.370
Like the animation goes along destroying.

76 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:26.832
Okay. Yeah, we can kind of figure something out like that. Do you know how they did it roughly?

77 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:10:26.832 --> 00:10:42.986
I have NO idea. I mean I I mean one of us can just work on the Jacobry part and I don't know, maybe you can get something out. If you can't then just throw the idea.

78 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:59.510
I think that's a good idea that we can, we could talk, we could definitely consider. Yeah, Yeah, because basically this is how it's set up right now, at least on with the homepage if you see my, if you see the whiteboard.

79 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:12.849
Okay, let me open my desktop real quick, I'll launch it locally and check if I can see anything. So branch again, adding webpage? Oh wait, NO, that's not it.

80 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:11:12.849 --> 00:11:18.090
I think it's, wait, did I, did I make a pull request?

81 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:23.726
You did, but I want to like check on my, like, github desktop.

82 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:27.691
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

83 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:34.665
And class fetch, NO, that's not it. Do you go to the branch name, add napbar.

84 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:11:34.665 --> 00:11:42.133
The branch name I called it, reorganized layout, I think.

85 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:48.232
Reorganize the ok. Oh I forgot to pull up version, my bad.

86 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:11:48.232 --> 00:11:49.431
Yeah, NO worries.

87 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:11:49.431 --> 00:12:13.217
Oh, I didn't see shit, what, just check on. So.

88 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:12:13.217 --> 00:12:22.557
Oh, give me 1 s. Okay let me check the github website.

89 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:12:22.557 --> 00:12:26.270
Can you quickly share on Webex?

90 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)

Oh yes, I'll put the share. Okay.

91 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:48.792

92 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:49.914
Yeah, just.

93 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:12:49.914 --> 00:12:57.412
Oh yeah yeah yeah this this one, this one has three commits, this is all my commits.

94 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:12:57.412 --> 00:13:07.784
In class fetch. Oh, it is called in class fetch. Okay, so I'm right. Yeah, yeah, ok. Check.

95 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:13:07.784 --> 00:13:16.323
Oh, it, oh, I must have, I think I renamed it on my desktop. That's must be.

96 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:13:16.323 --> 00:13:22.141
Why I renamed the bridge on my desktop.

97 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:27.065
Yeah. Oh, I see. Oh I see, ok. Yeah.

98 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:37.712
Yeah, that's what I have right now. I also added in our web. I also I use gimp real quick. I was able to get the, the wind share logo with NO back.

99 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:13:37.712 --> 00:13:41.072
Around. Oh, oh wait, I did that ready.

100 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:13:41.072 --> 00:13:43.947
Well, yeah, yeah, but I, I guess.

101 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:53.268
Yeah, yeah, I forgot to update it too I forgot to update it to you guys because one of the wire frames I had to manually just remove the background.

102 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:13:53.268 --> 00:13:57.048
You know, but NO worries. We, we got that all sorted out now.

103 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:13:57.048 --> 00:14:07.469
And do you want the version without like the white space on the back? Because you know there's still white space in the middle of the circle, right? I room I remove all of the white white spaces.

104 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:14:07.469 --> 00:14:13.489
Yeah, either way is fine. It I don't I don't think it will hurt if we add it later.

105 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:14:13.489 --> 00:14:17.708
Yeah, I mean, I can just update it anytime, so doesn't really matter.

106 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:18.829
Yeah.

107 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:26.804
Yeah, I just want to tell you guys that like there's this option that I already created that picture. So if you want to use it, just use it.

00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:33.389

00:17:56.474 --> 00:18:02.815
I mean we can just sure, but or Yeah sure.

131 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:06.998
I bet there's something we could throw a throat into just to.

132 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:18:06.998 --> 00:18:14.077

00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:39.137
Yeah. And if you go to the whiteboard, I also added like a simple login page idea for the login page. It would just be like.

00:18:54.815 --> 00:18:56.436
It's just a login page so.

139 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:18:56.436 --> 00:19:11.078
Yeah, also, I, I'm think I With the logo at least, that, it had a really good color palette. I think that we can use that for the, the website itself.

140 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:19:11.078 --> 00:19:14.398

141 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:19:14.398 --> 00:19:20.756

142 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:19:20.756 --> 00:19:23.479
Right.

143 "Collins, Joshua" (2734173952)
00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:45.919
We could we can use another color later on, but I mean like as 1st starting point that's not a bad that's not a, that's not a bad combination of colors and we could use that for our websites layout or like at least like palette. Yeah. So the resolution.

144 "Hung, Louis" (3464415488)
00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:52.545
I'm gonna try to run it through like another resolution of created something online later.
