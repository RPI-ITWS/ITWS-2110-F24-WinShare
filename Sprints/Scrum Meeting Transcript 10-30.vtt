1 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.714
Time period from last sprint to till now, ok?

2 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:05.491
Okay.

3 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:31.969
Okay, like, yeah, last retro till now answering that so our questions are same, so I will just give you one by one question in the chat and let's just discuss over those and try to give your individual answers what you think about those answers and if everyone try to participate, that's good. And since you have to add this I think have you started the recordings?

4 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.672
Okay. Yeah, I just started the recordings. Yeah, yeah, right, ok.

5 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:53.311
Alright so 1st question is like what you liked in this sprint, what you liked about the sprint?

6 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:00:53.311 --> 00:01:04.093
I'm go 1st. I I really liked the our improved communication and reliability during this sprint.

7 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:20.874
And, I also liked the, I liked the kind of I liked the updated UI, at least in terms of layout. I think we did a good job with that so far.

8 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:22.470
Anyone else?

9 "izik" (103924224)
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.272
Yeah, oh night. Oh, ok. So.

10 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:48.010
I'll go then. Okay, so I really liked about how we're like improving from our sprint, the 1st sprint about like having weekly meetings every Wednesday and almost every Saturday, and I think that makes our communication very efficient during this whole sprint and makes I guess all of us that participated in the meeting really.

11 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:59.750
Just stay on track of what each other's doing and we also utilize the project function in GitHub that makes it like makes we know what we're each working on currently.

12 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:14.623
Yeah ok good also just to reminds me of at the end we will just quickly review your project board, ok? At the end. Okay anyone else who wants to go and yeah.

13 "izik" (103924224)
00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:30.186
Yeah I was gonna say that, what I thought I liked is that we were all on board. Everyone agrees on everything, everything we do, and I think that's really vital to a project.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:36.545
Can one of you guys display our project board? I I'm on my phone.

15 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:40.961
I'll do a room. Then we will do at end after all the questions.

16 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:41.664
As a finished.

17 "izik" (103924224)
00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:42.571
Oh, ok, ok.

18 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:51.881
Okay, yeah. One thing I wanted to tell you guys, you know, I think that that's your team, right? Which had that animation for the scoreboard.

19 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:59.247
That's your team, right? Just build that animations in this code while displaying this core board.

20 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:02.385
The scoreboard, like the leaderboard?

21 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:06.485
Yeah, right. That's in your application, right? Your team has been.

22 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.625
Doing that right? Oh yeah, I built that.

23 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:27.500
Yeah, that was a good thing. I mean I liked that particular scoreboard. It was very, you know, it's kind of a very realistic like you see in games or something like that. So that was good. Just wanted to highlight that so ok so next question we have.

24 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.020
That is what you learned in this sprint.

25 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:55.624
I I for one learned a lot more about JavaScript and getting basically like a good functionality with displaying information, whether that might be like a search bar with a dropdown or overall just filtering a user's input in JavaScript to get a desired display based off of that.

26 "Shimu" (1785532928)
00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:57.268
Okay.

27 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:03:57.268 --> 00:03:59.121
Oh golden.

28 "Shimu" (1785532928)
00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:28.840
So I learned a lot about the API we're gonna use so well most sport radar where I know what the API offers us that we could use, and I also know like the weaknesses of the API that information that they do not like directly give you. So now that I know that, you know, if the API is missing some information that we need, we should try to store some of the information by ourselves.

29 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.696
Okay. Thank you.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:49.117
Yeah, and we try to get around that shortcoming by using two APIs, but even then there are certain bits of information that we just simply can't get from either one of them or any API that is free for that matter, and Isaac.

31 "izik" (103924224)
00:04:49.117 --> 00:05:06.646
Yeah, I I learned a lot about this more CSS stuff, I learned a lot about containers and, and how to edit certain things, really, really the small things, how to move things from one side to the other using Flexbox and stuff like that.

32 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:22.260
Okay, so let's move to the next question which is what you lagged during the sprint.

33 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:55.021
I, for me, I I liked getting my input player input box on the statistics page so that a user types in the input, a dropbox will come down and you can click on a, a desired player or you can type in the player's name fully, and based off of that, that's the only inputs that the input, the input will allow and the other input won't let you click the buttons.

34 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:00.801
And that's it. Yeah.

35 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:09.060
Okay, anyone else?

36 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.196
I'll go next. I think what we really liked in this sprint.

37 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:17.378
I.

38 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:22.918
No liked. It's slacked. It's lacked.

39 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:54.839
Oh sorry oh oh my bad. Well, we lacked I just think, just based off of where we are in the, in our school semester, I think we locked lacked a little bit of cohesion with, some people more than others, but for the most part we stayed like really on top of things, but every once in a while you would go like a week or two without hearing from well like a few days to a week without hearing from somebody cause they had to study for a test. Yeah.

40 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:06:54.839 --> 00:07:17.241
That's really, I I also have the same opinion right here, so like cause it has been the midterm week last week, so some of us are not responding to each other on like maybe and like some other sprints, someone's missing, but I guess overall we still did it quite a good job in this group community.

41 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.795
Patients.

42 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:29.041
And I guess it's just other academic pressures that's keeping us up a bit off the loose sometimes, but generally we're doing good.

43 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:37.234
Yeah, I mean that's ok that is bound to happen, right? So we have to manage things around that.

44 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:07:39.123 --> 00:07:41.481
Okay, anyone else?

45 "Shimu" (1785532928)
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:44.559
I think I noticed the same things that they.

46 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:07:44.559 --> 00:08:13.999
You said alright ok so we can move to our last question, which is what you learned for during this sprint. So I just want to give a brief like here now you we want to discuss the things like if there are any improvement areas, do you feel you know let's just say I mean what you it's in kind of an open end question to express, you know, like is there been missing.

47 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:22.564
Something among you or things are not going good. So those kind of a thing you can highlight in this question.

48 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:08:22.564 --> 00:08:42.289
Okay, I well on for myself personally, I kind of, I felt like I was a little less productive than again because of midterms and tests and for the next sprint I'm gonna try and be a little bit more diligent on on getting my stuff done earlier in the sprint rather than the back half.

49 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:08:42.289 --> 00:09:03.229
Cause the 1st sprint I was better at keeping things pretty evenly distributed throughout the sprint when I was working. Yeah, and that's why I aimed for more of during this last sprint session and then from and as a team as and as a whole a group, a whole group, I would say I'm, I just.

50 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:09:03.229 --> 00:09:12.985
On a little bit more clearer communication especially when it comes to like, guys, I I have this activity or I have this test I have to study for, I can't be.

51 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:15.039
Here. I I just.

52 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:21.063
So like a little bit more clear communication from some individuals that when we have, when you can't show.

53 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:09:21.063 --> 00:09:23.948
Can you just explain like why? Cause.

54 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:09:23.948 --> 00:09:31.365
I mean if you have a test that's fine, but if you're like, if you're not showing up because you just don't feel like it, that's.

55 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:09:31.365 --> 00:10:08.319
Different. Right, correct. Okay. Yeah, so this is something, you know, which as a team you have to take into accountability because, at the end you try to distribute things and try to complete your task and what at the end, you know, that's another person's responsibilities as well, right? Because they are also responsible towards working, I mean in this particular project. So you can if you feel like things are not working out, I would suggest as a team have a discussion and see how can you make it work.

56 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:10.341
Okay.

57 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:35.089
Same here for, for my part, like I think I personally having trouble is to one is converting one is actually creating some information from the API datas but that's because of personal issue. So it's really just me not having enough time to put into that I wanted to make sure I finished during the sprint, but it turns out I ran out of time.

58 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:54.162
And that I would try to finish as soon as possible. And for the team, I'm just more concerned about some individual not doing enough work as the others because, last time I checked he did four commits for other semester.

59 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:10:56.645 --> 00:11:09.045
And that individual hasn't showed up to any scrum meetings, I believe, since the start of the semester.

60 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:16.169
Okay.

61 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:35.228
All right, actually, yeah, I mean at the end we will definitely have a peer review. This is what I came to know from dr. Panam. So if you feel something is not going and you can highlight all these things that didn't went well as a team in the peer reviews so we can keep into accountability.

62 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.789
Before that. Yeah, definitely.

63 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:56.179
Yes. Okay. So these are the questions that we had to discuss. Does anyone have anything else to highlight for that particular last question? So the thing is I would say see if you have anything, this is the platform you.

64 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:11:56.179 --> 00:12:12.708
You can discuss it and try to normalize the situations for your team dynamics, ok? So if anyone have any concern like if you want to highlight, you can highlight in this platform.

65 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:27.134
Yeah, I'm just gonna be honest like I I think with everybody here at least we're, we're doing, we're doing very well as a group together, and I don't think we I don't think we have any issues with, with this group before. Thank you.

66 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:12:27.134 --> 00:12:41.090
Okay. All right, that's good. So we can quickly review the project board, the backlog and then after that we can wrap up this call.

67 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:47.767
I'm Isaac, would you mind doing that?

68 "izik" (103924224)
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:57.087
Yeah, 1 s.

69 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:12:58.148 --> 00:13:06.909
I will say that we did add a new column to the project where we have like nice, a column called nice.

70 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:09.149
To have which were made.

71 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:12.288
Which are mainly things that we plan on doing or tackling in the next.

72 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:14.168
Correct.

73 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:20.450
Okay. And and then done is just everything we have currently done from the start up until now.

74 "Shimu" (976671232)
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:28.635
Right. Yeah.

75 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:31.559
Okay.

76 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:51.559
So I would suggest one more thing. Are you guys tracking bug creations and defect or like if you found any defect? Because topical specifically mentioned along with the tickets you have to maintain if you have any bug or you have identify any bug. So create the bugs as well. So.

77 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:59.333
So I would suggest to start tracking it so if he at the end of the semester he will see all these things, right?

78 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:02.596
Yeah, so I think we have both of our bugs and.

79 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:14:02.596 --> 00:14:04.339
Issues and I think we.

80 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:06.678
Yeah, we closed multiple, we closed two.

81 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:24.976
Already So that's a good thing, yeah, because I don't want you guys to miss anything, so that is I mean have everything in your repository so that you know we don't lack points anywhere. Okay, so that is good thing you are tracking everything so yeah good.

82 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:27.323
Yeah, thank you so much for your.

83 "Mandloi, Priyanka" (1184103936)
00:14:27.323 --> 00:14:39.118
Your time. Yeah, NO worries, yeah. I just my office available only soon and that's the purpose of this ok right so yeah we can wrap up.

84 "Hung, Louis" (2193208576)
00:14:39.118 --> 00:14:40.398
And.

85 "izik" (103924224)
00:14:41.356 --> 00:14:42.373
Thank you so much.

86 "Collins, Joshua" (3013193472)
00:14:42.373 --> 00:14:44.124
Thank you. Yeah, have a good day.
